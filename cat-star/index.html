<h1>Winter on an Island</h1>

<!--h2>Eco Travel School</h2-->

<p>My mom has been a travel agent for almost 12 years. Her company arranges one-of-a-kind trips to exotic locations. Twice a year she provides a travel school destination for families seeking to get away from their regular routine.</p>

<p>Tonight I'm tossing laundry in the wash and a bookmark falls out of my pocket, reminding me of the research notes Austen and I worked on at the restaurant. I told my mom this material on <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-10-massive-filaments-fuel-growth-galaxies.html">galaxies and filaments</a> would be good to include in this year's December trip, since we'll be traveling to a location with wide polar skies.</p>

<p>Okay, I'll take a break from setting up the challenge and shift over to preparing the study guide. 
The draft pages are bound by string laced through a soft leather cover onto which I've pasted a rendering of the filaments of the&nbsp;universe.  It looks rather like the strings of suds forming at the top of the churning laundary in front of me.

<p>We've been documenting where galaxies form - and it's almost always where massive plasma filaments of hydrogen collide to fuel their growth.</p>

<p>"Over 99% of the matter making up the universe is in the form of plasma. Plasma is sometimes considered to be the 4th state of matter after solid, liquid and gas. When the atoms of a gas are ionized or have their electrons stripped off, they then exist as a collections of positively charged atomic nuclei (or ions) and negatively charged electrons. When these charged particles move, they form an electric current. Furthermore, every electric current has a circling magnetic field. This circling magnetic field constrains the plasma to form hydrogen filaments and sheets, with vast voids in between. A plasma universe, therefore, is not expected to be modeled and controlled by gravitational forces, but rather by the forces of electricity and magnetism. It comes as a shock to realize that, out in space, the forces of electricity and magnetism can be up to 10^39 times stronger than gravity."

Plasma in the lab forms shapes like galaxies during mergers - a shape that otherwise defies gravity.

	Small, satellite galaxies align in a plane: the same orbital plane that the main galaxy's disk is found. 
	Galaxies around massive black holes spin at a right angle (orthogonal) to their nearest filament. As a consequence, their galactic plane will be parallel to the filament and we thus expect an excess of satellites in the plane of the central&nbsp;galaxy.

	The orbital plane is perpendicular to the hydrogen filament feeding the galaxy. "Some are progressively deflected from alignment with the filament by gravitational torquing from the central galaxy."

<p>At least I thought it was. Until something arrived early. Actually two somethings. And things have been turned upside down ever since.</p>

In the winter we would travel down to Yucatan.</p>

	<h3>Dark Matter is a Superfluid</h3>
	“A superfluid is a very interesting kind of fluid,” says Khoury. “Most substances we find in the laboratory form a solid when cooled to a low enough temperature. But a certain set of substances, such as liquid helium, effectively remain a liquid all the way to absolute zero temperature. The uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics forbids these atoms from arranging into crystalline structure, and instead they remain fluid, but it’s a very peculiar kind of fluid. It flows without viscosity, doesn’t carry any entropy, and has many other strange behaviors.” - 
	<a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/physicist-theorizes-dark-matter-superfluid">Superfluid</a>
</p>
<p>
	"The standard theory says that as the universe evolved, dark matter coalesced to form clumps and strands in a vast “cosmic web.” Ordinary hydrogen gas collected in the clumps to form stars and flowed along the filaments to feed the growing galaxies. Astronomers have seen how the gravity of the web’s filaments distort the images of more distant galaxies, making them align slightly, like fish swimming in a school."

	<h3>Hidden Gravity</h3>
	Dark matter is something that does not interact at all with light. "Physicist Lisa Randall therefore prefers the term transparent matter. But it may not be matter at all. It's something invisible that generates an anomalous gravitational pull. I’m under no illusions that I am going to displace “dark matter” as the go-to term, but “<a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/dark-matter-is-real-dark-matter-is-a-terrible-name-for-it">hidden gravity</a>” is a far superior description. We already know of one family of particles that behaves as dark matter: the neutrinos. They do not engage with light or with the strong nuclear force, but do contribute a gravitational effect. They just don't contribute nearly enough to account for the observed evidence." - Corey&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Powell, Discover Magazine

<h1>From an Artic Dream</h1>
<!-- Feb 2, 2017 -->

<p>The two of us are up on a cliff watching the children from the other tribe below. A young boy and girl who have learned to fish with a net. Skinny and lanky, they play on the edge of the cool water and splash in the net.</p><br>

<p class="lyrics">Nobody passes us in the deep quiet of the dark sky.<br>
Nobody sees us alone out here among the stars.</p><br>

<p>I comment to you that our tribe should do the same, fish with nets. We are pondering that we might then overfish the area, so we should consider moving our own tribe away from the mouth of this northern river. The new tribe has only recently arrived, but more are gradually making their way up to the north end of the river.</p>

<p class="lyrics">Through a fault of our designing,<br>
We are lost among the windings.</p>

<p>Our tribe's eventual decision, to begin migrating east away along the artic coast away from the mouth of the river, will ultimately lead us to the wall of ice.</p><br>
