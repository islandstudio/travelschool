<h1>Chapter 2 - The Inner Inlet</h1>

"No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure."<br><br>

The hands of the southern gentleman hold an old metal book, he runs his finger along spiral rings that surround the edges of its tiny copper cover.  Dressed in a white shirt and suspenders, he sits at a table in an old farm house near a saltwater inlet.  Boys are playing outside on a hot day, the corn fields russell and a small boat rattles gently against a dock.<br><br> 

Near the banks of a tidal river at an old coastal home on the protected side of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a large man in a white shirt and suspenders rocks back on a porch as several boys play nearby in fields of corn and cotton beside the house and down by a river.

A boy's voice: "No one really knows how long the shoreline is.  It just winds around and around, over boulders and stones, sand and silt, curving around the smallest, teeny tiny specs of rock, and then it wraps a little further."<br><br>

The boys lazily swing swinging out over the water on a thick rope tied to an old willow whose branches dipped down into the water.  Their heads move inches from the water's surface and muddy bank.  Crawfish move through the shallow water beneath their hovering, inspecting eyes.  A turtle makes a resonating &#8220;plunk&#8221; sound as it shifts off a log.  Time is moving in slow motion on this hot North Carolina afternoon.<br><br>

An old apple tree watches over the back yard.  Smaller crab apple trees form a row of silent sentinals along one side of the house. The home is surrounded by fields, corn and cotton.  Across the fields, another farm house stands at the end of a long line of magnolias.<br><br>

A young girl lives there across the field.  Her father whistles loud, two fingers in his mouth.  The sounds carries so far we swear he is standing in our own backyard.  Out across the sandbox it carries, and for a moment the cicada are silent, listening to the long deep note carry across the fields.  I've tried many times to whistle like that, it's a lost art form.<br><br>

This is where we spent long summers, three boys, our older brother away at the academy.<br><br>

This summer, a family friend has come to stay, Lukas Owens.  Michael is much younger than us, only 5, but he strives to keep up with us none the less.  Greg is 10 and I'm 11.  Izzy, our fearless leader is 12, almost 13.<br><br>

We peer into the corn fields, tall and bristly. It's running weather.  Hot, but soon cool when bodies are in motion.  We cut into the fields, corn towering over our heads.  We've stashed our clothes amid the rows and weeds beneath the stalks.  The clods of dirt are uneven, and Michael trails behind, but we're good to make sure we never lose sight of him, his short legs working double time to keep up with our lankier forms.<br><br>

Careful not to break the corn or knock off a budding ear.<br><br>

We come to the edge of the fields, peering through at the white house where the girl lives.  We never see her, only the linen drapes blowing in the window caught in the light of the setting sun.<br><br>
