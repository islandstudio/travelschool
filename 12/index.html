If half his DNA was God's, we shouldn't rule out that he could morph and change his race. Crispr gene editing is bringing us closer to that prospect today. We also should not rule out that Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera from Germany was an embodiment of God who wrestled two panthers in Ethiopia before he traveled to Israel to father Christ, without sex of course. That nonsexual experience may have still been wonderful for Mary, maybe even better than real sex. Perhaps it occurred in a dream.

Better yet would be a council of angels involved in the selection of Christ's DNA chromosomes. Perhaps 12 representing all regions of the world, with Tiberius among them. He could have stopped in Ethiopia along the way and traveled onward to Israel with a black friend, who turns out to be the forefather of Haile Selassie. Perhaps the three wise men were also members of a council contributing their world DNA to the baby Jesus. Christ's Y chromosome could have been contributed by God himself, so there was one true father. Six of the twelve DNA contributors could even have been women.

So would God be #12 or #13 in this council? Or should there be a rep for each of the 23 chromosomes contributed? To keep the headcount manageable, perhaps 11 council members could each contribute two chromosomes halves, with God contributing the contributing his Y pair. Perhaps none of the other council members would have known who among them was the Y donor, to further build on God's mysterious ways.

Fortunately the central location of Israel allows for a mixing of genes and value systems without all the planning effort. And parenthood will remain traditional for the time being, despite God's prior radical departure from the norm of two parents, and the subsequent backlash against a young man whose mother had to be strong to protect her honor.
