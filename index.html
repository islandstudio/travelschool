  As you get closer to death, closer to the dream surface, ideas and symbols begin to blur. Memories fall into compartments, vases of fine dust on a shelf, worth pouring through, but seemly shallow in their essense. Each offers up a part of the whole, but indendent of charge the dust can hold you no more.

<h1>Finding Neutrino</h1>

<h2>Expedition Journal: The Energy of Waves</h2>


<div class="audioscape">
<p>
Moog wasn't going to let another drone puck go by. Diving across the snowdrift, he swung to push the flying puck out over the kids' heads, and watched it work it's way toward the opposite goal, blades humming, as the kids applied movements and air body-slams to move it down the court. The rules were no contact with the flying puck. Its sensors responded to the gestures and intent of each player. Mesh over the blades protected hands from the rotors during occasional finger glances, which also incurred a 1-point penalty. 
</p>

<p>
The puck's response was fast, it was hard to actually hit if you wanted to because it anticipated based on a neural network connected to every player's EEG rig. Using the combination of arm movement and your EEG headset reading, you could swing one way, and simultaneously tell the puck to fly in the other direction using your eyes to fake out another player. When two player intents collided, the puck often shot straight up like a magnet flipping out of a field.
</p>

<p>
Moog moved swiftly when he wanted to and looked especially tall and slender in his red, yellow and green arctic snow suit. Years of playing hackysack on Caribbean beaches made him quick and nibble, even for his late 40s. Surrounded with a circle of five kids, dreadlocks tied in the back, arms folded across his chest, he stepped swiftly through the flurry of feet to recover control of the puck by raising his hands up with a sudden burst on either side of it. It came to a halt within the football goal of his extended arms. Moog gave it a slight mental tap forward, followed by an exaggerated full body air punch which sent it cantering toward Jen, wide open across the ice field near the entrance road to IceCube. She gave a final small mental nudge and a flick of the wrist to win the game, and we all rushed for the steaming hot coco and donuts Reg had brought to the side of the field - the winning team got first dibs on the jelly filling, so I made sure to grab a blueberry one for Alison.
</p> 

<p>
Behind us on the sea-ice stood the two tallest buildings on the continent -- the IceCube Lab where scientists searched for almost undetectable subatomic particles -- neutrinos.

<h2>The "IceCube" Telescope</h2>

<p>
The Neutrino Detection Project, led by Dr. Peter Gorham, a physicist from the University of Hawaii, was the first scientific group to detect the highest known energy neutrinos in the universe. He excitedly gushes (though still struggles finding the words to describe something he's only beginning to understand): "The neutrino is the most ridiculous particle you can imagine. They exist, but we can't get our hands on them, because they seem to just exist in another place.  And, as a physicist, even though I understand it mathematically, and I understand it intellectually, it still hits me in the gut that there is something here, surrounding me, almost like some kind of spirit or God, that I can't touch, but I can measure it. I can make a measurement. It's like measuring the spirit world, or something like that... From Encounters at the End of the World (2007)
</p>

&#8220;Neutrinos are electrically neutral leptons, and interact very rarely
with matter. When they do react with the molecules of water in the ice,
they can create charged leptons (electrons, muons, or taus). These
charged leptons can, if they are energetic enough, emit Cherenkov
radiation. This happens when the charged particle travels through the
ice faster than the speed of light in the ice, similar to the bow shock
of a boat traveling faster than the waves it crosses. This light can
then be detected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) within the digital
optical modules (or DOMs) making up IceCube. Even though it is located
in Antarctica, IceCube is more sensitive to point sources more in the
northern hemisphere than the southern. It can observe astrophysical
neutrino signals from any direction, but in the southern hemisphere
these neutrinos are swamped by the downgoing cosmic-ray muon
background.&#8221;  - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory" target="IceCube">More</a></p>
 

<p>Neutrinos carry away most of the gravitational energy released by the collapse of massive stars. Electric charge-free and with an extremely small mass (0.1 eV or greater, compared with about 0.5 MeV for the electron), the neutrino is considered a key element, because it can relate both with matter and dark matter - if there is such a thing.

<!-- "A very interesting possibility – postulated in 1977 by Murray Gell-Mann, Pierre Ramond and Dick Slansky – is that the neutrino masses are inversely proportional to the high-energy scale at which the quark-lepton symmetry is broken."

Computer data shows a neutrino impact amid IceCube's hollow columns.</p>
 
<p>"In 2013, the IceCube neutrino experiment at the South Pole reported the observation of two ultra-high-energy neutrino events, which they named after Sesame Street characters <a href="/travelschool/sun/img/bert-and-ernie.png">Bert and Ernie</a>. The third, they nicknamed "Big Bird".</p>

<p>
In 2018 Astronomers traced a high-energy neutrino to its cosmic source for the first time, the jets of a Blazer black hole which points in our general direction from within the Orien constellation.  Cosmic rays are emitted simultaneously, but their charged nature causes them to take a meandering&nbsp;path.

<h2>The Energy of Waves</h2>

<br>
<h3>Through our eyes the universe is perceiving itself - Alan Watts</h3>
<br>

<p>At the opposite pole, the Inuit man paddles harder and harder, left, right, left, right. 
On the edge of air and water, his kayak glides past walls of ice and rocky 
outcroppings. Faster he glides, with each even stroke accelerating the
craft on the smooth surface away from the turbulent shoreline.</p>
 
<p>This morning I gradually awoke, still gliding along the
icy artic coast, the voice of an elder in my mind. 
&#8220;When you travel the surface between elements, find the rhythm. There you will move faster than among either
element alone.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>As I paddle, near the massive outcropping, my efforts are slowed.  Buffeted by waves as they bounce off the rocks and set my boat rocking, counter to my efforts.  It is not until I adjust my strokes to use the rocking to my advantage that I can use the rhythmic waves to increase my speed.</p>
 
 <p>
 "It's similar to the waves we see on the ocean," said Unruh. "They are not affected by the intense dance of the individual atoms that make up the water on which those waves ride."

<h2>TeVeS - I Still Believe</h2>
<br>

<p>Yesterday we found another guest to invite...<br>
Chinese astronomer Sheng Zhao. <!-- FIND OR INVITE ANOTHER--> 
</p>



<p>Tensor-vector-scalar gravity (TeVeS) – a 'simple' formula that
explicitly tells how gravity should behave in the transition zone
between the solar system, where the golden laws of Newton and Einstein
apply, and the outskirts of galaxies. 
 
 It’s a MOND theory that works perfectly for most galaxies. But it has yet to explain the bullet cluster. 

 MOND stands for <a href='http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/091105-missing-matter.html'>MOdified Newtonian Dynamics</a>, discovered by the Israeli physicist Prof. Dr. Mordehai Milgrom.
 </p>

<p>&#8220;Under MOND, mass is much more effective at bending space-time than
under General Relativity, so it takes less stuff in the universe to
account for all the gravity we measure.  When applied to just galaxies,
MOND can predict very well the behavior that astronomers observe. But
when MOND is applied to larger structures like clusters of galaxies, it
fails. To make MOND work for clusters, it must include more complicated
concepts, such as entities called dark fields, which are different from
dark matter, but work in a similar way to alter the amount of gravity
present.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>
  "One primary success of TeVeS is that it provides an enhancement of gravitational lensing, which could not be achieved by other MONDian theories." - <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/687344">2005</a><br><br>

How Would Galaxies Form in a Universe Without Dark Matter? <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/how-would-galaxies-form-in-a-universe-without-dark-matter-researchers-find-out/">Researchers Find Out in 2020</a>
  
</p>
 
<p>
The Bullet cluster and others exhibit that under the right conditions, gravity exhibits non-local effects. 
One of the surviving MOND theiries is MOG, a theory of gravity with non-local effects akin to quantum physics on the scale of galaxy clusters - when the density of surrounding matter becomes sparse and light moves faster without the warping influence of gravity. a.k.a. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_delay">Shapiro delay</a>.

<h2>Pole to Pole</h2>
<br>

<p>Back in the Inuit villiage, a group of colorfully dressed children are winding ribbons around a May pole, braiding colors to a circling rhythm.</p>
 
<p>The May Day celebration has ended and the older boys have the task of removing
the pole. The first two tug and push to no avail, stuck in the frozen
mud.  A third, smaller boy, approaches the pole and sets his hand on it and
gives a little push. Then another gentle push, and another, and soon the
top of the pole is vibrating back and forth. With a slight upward push of his hand with each nudge, the bottom of the pole slowly rises out of the permafrost.</p>
 
<p>Back and forth, back and forth. Pole to pole.</p>

<p>Shortly before his Artic trip, Langford had dropped out of college to pursue a dream of restoring ice to polar tundra using a Peltier element that produced <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190419165531.htm">ice without energy</a>.

Within a year, the cooling technology we were developing took a profitable turn and became the very popular curb-side cooler business you know of today as "PopBox".  Designed so the lids were flush with ground level, the solar panel on the lid allowed the box to also heat a meal as residents returned home.
