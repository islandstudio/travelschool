<h1>Finding Neutrino</h1>





Out on frozen sea-ice, the two tallest buildings on Antarctica are located -- hangers which
scientists are using to launch giant balloons 40 kilometers into the
stratosphere to search for almost undetectable subatomic particles --
neutrinos.</p>

<h2>The "IceCube" Telescope!</h2>

<p>"The Neutrino Detection Project, led by Dr. Peter Gorham, a
physicist from the University of Hawaii, wants to be the first
scientific group to detect the highest energy neutrinos in the universe.</p>

&#8220;Neutrinos are electrically neutral leptons, and interact very rarely
with matter. When they do react with the molecules of water in the ice,
they can create charged leptons (electrons, muons, or taus). These
charged leptons can, if they are energetic enough, emit Cherenkov
radiation. This happens when the charged particle travels through the
ice faster than the speed of light in the ice, similar to the bow shock
of a boat traveling faster than the waves it crosses. This light can
then be detected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) within the digital
optical modules (or DOMs) making up IceCube. Even though it is located
in Antarctica, IceCube is more sensitive to point sources more in the
northern hemisphere than the southern. It can observe astrophysical
neutrino signals from any direction, but in the southern hemisphere
these neutrinos are swamped by the downgoing cosmic-ray muon
background.&#8221;  - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory" target="IceCube">More</a></p>
 

<p>Neutrinos carry away most of the gravitational energy released by the collapse of massive stars. Electric charge-free and with an extremely small mass, it is considered a key element, because it can relate both with matter and dark matter.</p>

<h2>Expedition Journal: 1/19/2010 - The Energy of Waves</h2>

<p>Tensor-vector-scalar gravity (TeVeS) is a disputed theory of modified
gravity that accounts for the flat rotation curves of galaxies. The
TeVeS theory requires massive neutrinos, hot dark matter to make the
equations work. We know longer believe in this theory.</p>
 
<p>From Encounters at the End of the World (2007):</p>

<p>"The Neutrino Detection Project, led by Dr. Peter Gorham, a
physicist from the University of Hawaii, wants to be the first
scientific group to detect the highest energy neutrinos in the universe.
He excitedly gushes (though still struggles finding the words to
describe something he's only beginning to understand): "The neutrino is
the most ridiculous particle you can imagine. ...They exist, but we
can't get our hands on them, because they seem to just exist in another
place. ...And, as a physicist, even though I understand it
mathematically, and I understand it intellectually, it still hits me in
the gut that there is something here, surrounding me, almost like some
kind of spirit or God, that I can't touch, but I can measure it. I can
make a measurement. It's like measuring the spirit world, or something
like that..."</p>
 
<p>Through our eyes the universe is perceiving itself... - Alan Watts</p>
 

<h2>I'll Follow the Sun, Pole to Pole</h2>

<p>At the opposite pole an Inuit man paddles harder and harder, left, right, left, right. On
the edge of air and water, his kayak glides past walls of ice and rocky
outcroppings. Faster he glides, with each even stroke accelerating the
craft on the smooth surface away from the turbulent shoreline.</p>
 
<p>This morning I gradually awoke from the paddling.  Gliding along the
icy artic coast, the voice of an elder in my mind. &#8220;When you
travel the surface between elements, you will move faster than through either
element alone.&#8221;</p>
 
<p>As I paddled, near the massive outcropping, my efforts were slowed. 
Buffeted by the waves as they bounce off the rocks and set my boat rocking,
counter to my efforts.  It is not until I adjust my
strokes to use the rocking to my advantage, then I can use the rhythmic
waves to increase my speed. This adjustment is the secret to many
things.</p>
 
 <p>
 "It's similar to the waves we see on the ocean," said Unruh. "They are not affected by the intense dance of the individual atoms that make up the water on which those waves ride."

<p>Yesterday we found another guest to invite, Chinese astronomer Sheng
Zhao.</p> 
 
<p>Tensor-vector-scalar gravity (TeVeS) – a 'simple' formula that
explicitly tells how gravity should behave in the transition zone
between the solar system, where the golden laws of Newton and Einstein
apply, and the outskirts of galaxies.  It’s a <a href='http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/091105-missing-matter.html'>Modified Theory of Newtonian Dynamics</a> (MOND) theory that works
perfectly for most galaxies.  But it has yet to explain the bullet
cluster.</p>
 
<p>&#8220;Under MOND, mass is much more effective at bending space-time than
under General Relativity, so it takes less stuff in the universe to
account for all the gravity we measure.  When applied to just galaxies,
MOND can predict very well the behavior that astronomers observe. But
when MOND is applied to larger structures like clusters of galaxies, it
fails. To make MOND work for clusters, it must include more complicated
concepts, such as entities called dark fields, which are different from
dark matter, but work in a similar way to alter the amount of gravity
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro_delay">Shapiro delay</a> - Radar signals passing near a massive object take
slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than it would
if the mass of the object were not present.&#8221; &nbsp;Time is delayed for light
traveling around a single mass.</p>
 
<p>Back in the Inuit villiage, a group of colorfully dressed children are
winding ribbons around a May pole.  Braiding colors to a circling
rhythm.</p>
 
<p>The May Day celebration has ended and the older boys have the task of removing
the pole. The first two tug and push to no avail, stuck in the frozen
mud.  A third, smaller boy, approaches the pole and sets his hand on it and
gives a little push. Then another gentle push, and another, and soon the
top of the pole is vibrating back and forth. With a slight upward push of his hand with each nudge, the bottom of the pole slowly rises out of the permafrost.</p>
 
<p>Back and forth, back and forth. Pole to pole.</p>

<p>Langford had dropped out of college to pursue a dream of returning ice to polar regions using a Peltier element to produce <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190419165531.htm">ice without energy</a>.

  But then the chilling technology we were developing took a profitable turn to become the very popular "PopBox" curb-side fridge business you know of today.  Designed so the lids were flush with ground level, the solar panel on the lid allowed the box to also heat a meal as residents returned home.
