I used to think of the kelp beds at my college as the mild empty ocean, not because they were empty of life, but because they could empty your thoughts of every concern from the world above. Some recent posts from our UCSB alumni group:
Shawn Howell: $99 PADI SCUBA certification my freshman year for a unit or two. Once living in Isla Vista we used to walk in our SCUBA gear from Seville Street down to the water at 10 PM and return with scallops, lobsters and crab around midnight when people were pretty drunk. Funny to see the reactions while carrying a spear gun, lobster decked out in full regalia . Filled our tanks for $.99, so it was a cheap way to eat really well.

Before anyone comments on a spear gun and lobster (illegal) we would either be after lobster with red/white flashlights and no spear or flounder and white light with spear.
Brent McQueen: I lived at 6681 DP and we had a rope to down the cliff and even a boat moored offshore. We went out all the time freediving. We shot fish, caught lobster and abalone. It was all legal back then. I even started an official Freedive Club at UCSB called the Santa Barbara Tar Heads. Those were great times!

At the time, I had no money but kept cookie sheets of halibut, lobster and abalone in the freezer. It's better than most people think out there.

Brent, was it you who got bit by a bull sea lion at Deep Kelp?
No, my brother got bit though and it freaked him out.
