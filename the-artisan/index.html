<h1>The Artisan</h1>


<p>Alex worked at a tool bench in a dimly lit workshop, a tiny pinpoint of light shone on the metalwork in his hands. His tools brushed and scraped against the uneven surface, flecking away dirt and sand to reveal grooves in the shimmering metal plate.</p>

<p>The pride in his efforts showed in his
  eyes as he turned a slightly smaller piece in his hand, wrapped it loosely, and gently added it to 
  the old briefcase. He placed several more in the case, then headed out into the approaching night.</p>

<p>He paused to wipe his brow and made a final inspection before wrapping the metal in cloth and placing it into a large carrying case filled with other work.</p>

<p>Outside, the last rays of sun illuminated a row of hillside homes in a Mid Eastern village. Curtains fluttered in windows. Doors stood open to capture the evening <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/01UYpHuzHi4eB9PAbDoPY2?si=doEJZEXjRtWOMTFVZiEIyQ" target="_blank">summer breeze</a>. Children played along the street. And the faint scent of jasmine was in the air as he ascended the hill to his house.</p>

<p>The side of a woman&#8217;s dress blows in the light wind as she stands by the
open door. Dinner is almost ready. A young girl is reading outside in the light of the doorway. 
She holds back her hair as it moves in the breeze, then lets it fall forward around her book as she leafs through its pages.</p>

<!--

<p class="lyrics">

See the curtains hanging in the window<br>
In the evening on a Friday night<br>
A little light a-shining through the window<br>
Lets me know every thing's all right</p>

<div class="lyrics">
{Refrain}<br>
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine<br>
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

<p>In another home faraway in North Carolina. A light haired boy, about 7, looks out a
window. His mother is working in the kitchen as he move across the room and peers out
the door and down the street of a college town with small shops. Down 7 stairs to streetlevel, students are walking by below, talking and eating yogurt and wearing toe socks. The song Summer Breeze is playing on the radio. The year is 1976.</p>

<p>The newspaper was <span class="GramE">laying</span> on the
sidewalk, so I picked it up and took it up to the house next door.
The music drifted out from inside, I tapped on the screen door, and entered a world lost from time. The lair of a professor and physicist, with tall shelves of books and ancient navigation instruments. I walked across the floor.</p>

<p class="lyrics">
See the paper <span class="GramE">laying</span> on the

So I walk on up to the door step<br>
Through the screen and across the floor</p>

<p>Our neighbor, professor Homer Wilkins, has inhabited this college town as far back as anyone can remember.  
	I set down the newspaper and looked around. Books fight for space in every spare nook in Homer's house and porch. A sun dial sends a faint shadow as light filters though the vines outside the porch, sparkling on the slowly swirling dust. I flip through one of my favorite books, it's massive worn cover, a deep reddish brown, shows a nautical instrument and I flip carefully through the old maps and star charts.</p>


<h3>Summer Breeze</h3>

<p>Under the starry Mediterranean sky, their father arrived home to the family's hillside farm. A farm which had been in the family for many generations. His briefcase was heavy, filled with work from the previous three months. The lights of the kitchen cast a warm glow across the yard and olive trees as he arrived at the door.</p>

<p>His wife turns to him from the window. The edges of her dress shimmer with a colorful array of gold and burnt amber patterns. He places the suitcase against a wooden chair in the corner of the kitchen. A warm pots bubbles on the stove. He inhales deeply, waving his hand to take in the aromas of Mediterranean spices, basil, sage, and bay laurel, then calls the two children to come eat.</p>

<p class="lyrics">Feel the arms that reach out to hold me<br>
In the evening when the day is through</p>

<p>After dinner, the young girl peers though her father's partially open
suitcase. Candlelight plays off copper and gold covers of tiny books
with rings around all their sides. A bundle of clay sculpting tools, old coins and a
stack of photos bound in a tattered piece of cloth.</p>

<p>Outside, her brother is throwing smooth stones into
a well. She joins him and the two watch the ripples overlapping in the light of the moon.

<!--
&#8220;Stones cast in your youth," she whispers, clutching the memorystone in her pocket, "reverberate the rest of your
life.&#8221;
