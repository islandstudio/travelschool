&#8220;That was your brain talking -- most dramatically, your amygdala, a necessary but frustrating part of the brain. The amygdala is the spot in the brain I accuse of making us seem to lack humility -- the part of our brain that can cause us to haughtily dismiss information we find threatening or don’t understand.&#8221;

Remarkably the Warwick led research team have found that if a combination of magnetic and electric fields is applied to these nano-rings they can actually then simply tune the electric field to freeze an exciton in place or let it collapse and re-emit a photon.

This video on nano-rings is better than a Saturday Night Live skit. Donuts, jam, chocolate – yum.

If photons are released from nano-rings when an electric field changes tune, then perhaps the light flashes in the Laurentian study disrupt the shared-tune initiated by the circulating magnet. Maybe light flashed in the eyes of one individual disrupts the tune, releasing trapped photons from the head of the other individual. Or maybe the addition of new photons bump the distant ones off the doughnuts.

I invited 12 of the top thinkers in the world to my last super to celebrate the cycling of the Mayan calendar.  We drank to our ancesters and fell back into the trance of time.

With the wine ceremony, we embraced spin, to loosen ones focus and become more tuned to the surrounding environment.  How did Mayan burning induce spin?
