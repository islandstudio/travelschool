2011-06-29 The Head of Bird Jaguar

&#8220;What’s that?&#8221;

&#8220;The head of Bird Jaguar&#8221;

A Lacandona legend tells that when the head of Bird Jaguar returns to its site, the world will be devastated by celestial jaguars.

I friend sent me this to watch soon:

I realized that I had found peace with my lust for other women, but that I hadn’t really thought about my relation to men.  The admirations and phobias.  The fluidity and confinement.

Dylan’s comfortable with himself.  I’m a big fan.

I wish I’d had a girlfriend at UCSB who was a math or physics major, with a strong sex drive.  Then perhaps I would have dove deeply into the math and science courses.  Maybe I needed a forest to really concentrate.

Dylan makes me very proud to be a UCSB alumni.

About our crew - This isn’t a team who can just talk about ideas, this is the best and brightest at actually creating.  In today’s world of fabrication, what can we create, orchestrate and implement from the deck of a boat?  How can we do so affordably, sustainably, with universal benefits?

Iron and Wine: Each Coming Night
Photons split and inhabit individual lives, returning to one in the end.  Which end is lonelier?

When I heard Dylan say that he would likely leave his quantum research to work on Wall Street, because there was no money in Physics, my heart fell a notch.  As a culture we need to reward and celebrate the great creative minds that are taking us to the new frontiers of science.  That’s why we created…

Physicists are describing the way we experience memory when they describe string theory.  Our thoughts go back in time momentarily when recalling an event.  The experience is not typically one we are aware of, but in dream-state that recall becomes a reality in its own right.  And we are jarred back to the present when we drift deeply into a dream thought.

&#8220;Whenever we awake, we have the propensity to be in a new universe.  But most of us are too ensnarled and confused to escape the present.  I was living in two at the same time.  One foot on the boat, the other on the bridge. Torn.&#8221; - Dylan Knife

[Arron Knife is a con man, a seller of snake-oil and dreams. You always return to the same universe, only perception changes.]

Dylan, always the incurable tinkerer, couldn’t resist the ultimate test of his new quantum invention.  If a tiny piece of metal could be sent into a magnetic dance, residing in two places at once.  Why couldn’t a human?  Calculating what it would take to achieve near zero temperature rapidly enough in the large vacuum chamber in the tunnel under the UCSB Physics Lab, Dylan devised an ingenious pivoting vacuum door to spin a human volunteer into the dark void of the large chamber fast enough to remove all air while his core temperature was dropped to near zero in a fraction of a second.  Fast enough to slow all his molecular movement simultaneously to avoid damage.

Then as the door swung shut in an instance of spinning super freezing, the moment of unexpected, unpredictable happened.  Like a knife, the vibration shook my crystalizing body, sending a wave that shook my torso with a sudden force and in one swift twist split my divine holiness into two halves, one tumbling into the past, the other accelerating into the future with a sudden woosh of awareness. At least that’s how it felt to me, the guys and Sarah back at the lab were not so fortunate.  For in that moment, that past ceased to exist.

And there on the floor lay my crystal skull, eyes peering out with the consciousness of the universe.  Missing only a body.  Potential with no action.  Dreams and action forever split.

Okay, sorta mentions the singularity.  Baby ‘ll make this work.  A trying song.

1715 or 1750?  Spanish Silver Fleet sunk by hurricane off coast of Florida.

Note added 7/21/2011 Cool coincidence: My mom is given coins for this sinking a week later from a new friend she meets with a metal detector on the beach.

Pirate Henery James/Genings - each pirate earned 10 years’ salary in one night. Go to form the island country of Nassau when Jamaica rejects them.

Anne Bonnie is the next pirate sensation after Black Beard.

In an earlier in time, Dutch Privateer Piet Hein captured an earlier Spanish Silver fleet in 1628…

Note for Deanna: I identify with Piet, I have him on my family tree site:

I’d like to follow the path of how the captured Spanish Gold was spent.

2011-07-03 Intro text / Clear head, blood incense

Hello
	Why are you here?

I’m not sure, turn on the light.

I want to be this…peace in living.

Dissecting the Mayan blood ritual

you refer to a ritual which acknowledges the power of the monthly menstrual cycle. the smoking part wasn't smoking as we know it but more smoking as in the way one burns incense, or smudging. this was not a ritual performed regularly but only in sacred tribute or as a petition for important matters of the community and could only be performed by a priest of a certain higher level ranking. there are glyphs which depict this ceremony and in fact there is reference to it in the popul vuh.

Curious if blood burned as incense has a different smell based on each individual?  Recent studies show that cells of the body communicate using quantum vibrations.  The sinuses detect vibrations.

Curious if blood burned as incense has a different smell depending on whose it is? We each have different levels of iron. Does a woman's blood smell different than a man's blood when burned? Try this experiment in a dark room after dinner.  Your brain processes smells differently when you are hungry.  See if you can tell whose blood you are smelling. Don't use the same poker to take your samples. Be sterile and safe.  We're dying to know the results, but no one needs to die in the process.

Bathed in the smoke as it went heavenward to communicate with Mayan ancestors.
Was the rope made out of the same vine as the tea in Peru?

With the brain drained of blood, both nostrils are open.

2011-07-09 swinging coherently in perfect unison

An atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a macroscopic quantum state in which all 
atoms are swinging coherently in perfect unison. When taking atoms in a BEC close to a 
Feshbach resonance, the fascinating prospect of creating coherent molecular matterwaves is opened.


I suspect Tom will continue to construct harmony from chaos. I've been reading about Feshbach resonance this morning. When it occurs, all atoms in a system swing coherently in perfect unison. If you come across a pattern you don't like, flip back to square one and start again. You can do it a moment's notice.

To James:
Fractals fascinate me because quantum and magnetic bonds use the same infinitely repeating patterns. Like looking directly at the process of Creation, or the ebbs and flow of daily life.

2011-07-11  92 pieces of DNA in the nucleus

Each healthy human cell contains 46 chromosomes, each comprised of 2 strands of DNA.

The two stands are not covalently bonded and thus separate molecules.

To research further:

In addition, each cell contains thousands of pieces of DNA

Each strand is constantly being damaged and repaired, so a single strand of DNA is actually many smaller pieces being reassembled by repair proteins.  

(But how do they know how to repair missing pieces?  Simply by looking at the other side of the chromosome?  What if segments on both sides are missing?)

Plus virus DNA floating in the cell.
