		<!--
		<p>I discovered I had two gifts that year. One for physics, the other less nobel.</p>

		<div class="main">

			<p>The realization came when I started aceing tests in college, while half asleep. Equations would just come to me, no conscious thought whatsoever.</p>

		 	<p>It didn't help that I was staying up until 3 a.m. most nights practicing with the band.<br><br>

		 	"Two" I mumbled unconsciously, my head on my folded arms asleep on the school desk. "Correct" the teacher responded with hesitation, pondering if his response would make it to me in my dream state.</p>

		</div>

		<div style="clear:both"></div>

		<div>

<!--
<p>The professors never ceased to be amazed, and the honors and awards continued to pour in. The soft purr of the radiator next to me kept me in a suspended state of lucidity, where I navigated a complex relm of equations that my fully conscious mind would have stumbled over, taking hours to grasp. Without the hum of the furnace, I was a B minus student at best.</p>

	<p>The other gift... deception.</p>

<p>Everything was great, but then the little headaches began.  They were minor. Most days I found that wearing a hat or head band made them stay away.  My roommate thought I was crazy because I ended up looking like Bjorn from ABBA most mornings.</p>

<hr><br>

<p>"Would you reconsider if I told you I had a brain tumor and only two months left to live?"  Of course, it would be a lie, but I'm never one short of trying.</p>

<p>"What? You have a brain tumor?"</p>

<p>"I'm lying, I think. At least I don't really know.  Sometimes I wonder.  Would you reconsider if I did?"</p>

<p>I'll never know why the line worked with Tess. We've been together ever since.</p>

<p>Years later, I got up late at night, drank a cup of water, laid back on the coach, and then in one instant, the focus headache was gone. Like the flipping of a switch. I'd been dehydrated all those years.</p>

<p>My advice to young writers, drink water.</p>

-->

<p>"To understand the roots of this story, you'd have to track down my classical guitar playing roommate, Toby Shepard," my dad began.  "Toby used to play his guitar upright, like a lute. 

He'd down a quart of whiskey and strum out the most beautiful chord combinations you'd ever heard just warming up. Then he'd jam, oh man how he'd jam, weaving medieval melodies around us long into the night, notes drifting off above the roofs of our college town here by the beach."</p>

<!--
<p>Poor Toby had a huge goose bump on the top of his head, I mean it looked like he'd been hit by the biggest cartoon baseball bat Fred Flintstone ever wielded, but he never had it checked out. Toby simply grew his hair long and nightly downed a quart of whiskey while he played the most beautiful guitar chords you'd ever heard.</p>
-->

<p>"Some nights we'd hide in the stacks and sneak into the secular antiquities section of the library to get the really old classical music books - manuscripts lined with gold, some scribed by monks over 600 years ago.  Toby would carefully open the pages while he sipped his bourban, warming up by playing ancient scales that created a sound so sweet to the ear as he began to give life to songs that had not seen the light of day since the middle&nbsp;ages."</p>

<p>"I guess one of the tunes must have stuck in my head, because when I strummed it out as a background track for the Finibus tour, I had no idea where it came from. Toby pointed out in his notebook, "It's this one, section 1.10.32-3 from the Epicurius codex based on Cicero." He'd been transcribing the musical notes that accompanied an old Italian epic poem. We ended up calling the song Epicurean Delight, and it had, shall we say, a certain addictive quality which drew out our friends to dance under the stars on the open porch that cool spring night."</p>

<p>"I was always impressed that a simple little rift, locked away for so many years, could become such a hit. I mean, here's a series of musical notes as old as Pope Pius II <!--born 1405--> topping the charts round the world," dad beamed.</p>

<p>"The first stop on the tour was Santa Cruz, From there we drove straight up to Humboldt, before circling back to hit a few small inland towns, snaking our way back toward San Francisco in the old bus, with Toby's cousins 1968 limo tagging behind. The reality of our success began to dawn on us as we rolled into Bakersfield - accompanied by our own tune playing from the local fairgrounds as evening transformed the surrounding central California desert."</p>

<p>"You'd think our mix of medieval music and dancehall reggae would sink like a brick here in the upper desert. We'd actually played a few miles away when we first started touring the prior year. The early songs went over like the Manson Girls playing at a bridge club meeting. "No sorry, we don't play any Dwight Yoakam or Skynyrd covers, regardless of how many times they'd ask." he laughed.</p>

<p>"With the new song getting radio play the week before, the crowd was packed solid in that little roadhouse bar. Drenched in sweat, they danced and pushed in close to the stage. The deep rock-steady base combined with the melodic background cords sent the whole house swaying.  We were a scene unto ourselves, a single crazy adredalen soaked heartbeat amplified into to a trance inducing beat amid the wide desert of moonlit crops, and confused cattle."</p>

<p>"This was an especially great night because my old friends Derek, Liam and Paul were there to join us on stage. Derek had moved back to the east coast and joined an ashram, Liam was coming through Bakersfield with his band Easy Big Fella on their way to LA, and Paul was up from LA scouting for film shoot locations. This was a night unequaled, the stage diving, the love from the crowd, the star-studied glints from the leather jackets and boots of the twirling girls' carried over the crowd. These were good times, these were the golden years before the storm." he said, glacing at the time on the monitor.</p>

<a href="img/finibus.jpg" class="floatright"><img src="img/finibus.jpg" /></a>

<p>"Somehow we always knew we'd only be a one-hit-wonder, so we lived large while the limelight was bright. Loaded up with gear and girlfriends, the bus headed south down backroads lined with strawberry fields and cattle ranches."</p>

<p>"When the front chassis broke on a bent cattle grill, half inebrated, we ended up trading the bus to a farmer for his beat-up hey trailer so we could continue the rest of the tour in the vintage limo, our equipment lashed precariously to the top of both to make the tight schedule. Things were at a fever pitch when we rolled into Oakland just in time that hot July night."</p>

<p>"That's where I first met your mom, at the Berkley concert, except she wasn't there to see the show.  She was working on a large tapestry that hung near the entrance to the theater. Toby called her over to ask if she could watch the trailer while we raced to carry in the woofers and tweeters, and the thing that goes ping."</p>

<p>"When I came back, Tess was lost in thought, sitting on the edge of the bumper, legs crossed and her finger sketching an invisible pattern on the top of her leg. I was transfixed. Her skin was a pale white, almost pearlescent, and the evening light caught the faint freckle patterns across her shoulders and down her back."</p>

<p>"Long before your mom worked on the textile team at Island Studio, she created digital fabric designs at Berkley using 3D images from a camera being developed in the spatial photography lab. The result was a dense, ever changing pattern of fractal shapes and designs, depending on the angle and lighting. Some days I'd just stare into the threads, lost in a maze that was crazy up-close, but even more insanely cool from across the room. I was really touched the night she made the band cloaks out of leftovers of the new material. We felt like royalty, brothers from another planet."</p>

<p>"One of my happiest memories was the glow everyone had after a really good show.  The feeling that we really were a great band, doing the right thing. Up so many late nights, laughing and reveling in the silliness of our sudden fame and the great adventure unfolding."</p>

<p>From coast to coast my parents traveled with the band, embarking for Europe as summer turned to fall. "The nights we spent adrift at sea were among my favorite," my dad smiled and continued. "Off the coast of Tripoli, the band sacked out on our way to Italy as waves lulled Tess and I to sleep. As the boat swayed, she softly recited a poem in her sleep, "Nam liber tempor cum soluta nobis eleifend."</p>

<p>"What? I said to myself, Tess's Latin was really good, but so good she could say it in her sleep? The water was lapping against the boat in the same rhythm. "Option congue nihil imperdiet doming id quod." Like the sounds she'd make when soothing a teething baby, of course none of you were around yet." he smiled. "Later I realized it was the Latin from the original epic poem that had inspired our song, she must have picked it up from reading it somewhere."</p>

<p>"That night, I dreamt of the clearest night sky you can imagine, with infinite detail. In the dream I was following the stars home, and one of the constellations matched the freckles on mom's back. "Typi non habent claritatem insitam; est usus legentis in iis qui facit eorum claritatem." he whispered, and soon I was drifting off to sleep too. I missed mom. Her night time poems were as hypnotic as a James Joyce novel, as calm as moonlite on a tranquil sea, they made me feel like I was rising and falling on a drifting boat, timeless and somehow everywhere at once.</p>
