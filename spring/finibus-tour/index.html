		<p>I discovered I had two gifts that year. One for physics, the other less nobel.</p>

		<div class="main">

			<p>The realization came when I started aceing tests in college, while half asleep. Equations would just come to me, no conscious thought whatsoever.</p>

		 	<p>It didn't help that I was staying up until 3 a.m. most nights practicing with the band.<br><br>

		 	"Two" I mumbled unconsciously, my head on my folded arms asleep on the school desk. "Correct" the teacher responded with hesitation, pondering if his response would make it to me in my dream state.</p>

<p>The professors never ceased to be amazed, and the honors and awards continued to pour in. The soft purr of the radiator next to me kept me in a suspended state of lucidity, where I navigated a complex relm of equations that my fully conscious mind would have stumbled over, taking hours to grasp. Without the hum of the furnace, I was a B minus student at best.</p>

	<p>The other gift... deception.</p>

<p>Everything was great, but then the little headaches began.  They were minor. Most days I found that wearing a hat or head band made them stay away.  My roommate thought I was crazy because I ended up looking like Bjorn from ABBA most mornings.</p>

<hr><br>

<p>"Would you reconsider if I told you I had a brain tumor and only two months left to live?"  Of course, it would be a lie, but I'm never one short of trying.</p>

<p>"What? You have a brain tumor?"</p>

<p>"I'm lying, I think. At least I don't really know.  Sometimes I wonder.  Would you reconsider if I did?"</p>

<p>I'll never know why the line worked with Tess. We've been together ever since.</p>

<p>Years later, I got up late at night, drank a cup of water, laid back on the coach, and then in one instant, the focus headache was gone. Like the flipping of a switch. I'd been dehydrated all those years.</p>

<p>My advice to young writers, drink water.</p>

-->

<p>To understand the roots of this story, you'd have to track down my classic-guitar-playing roommate, Toby Shepard.  Toby used to rotate his guitar sideways and play it like a lute. Then he'd jam, oh man how he'd jam, playing the most relaxing ancient Spanish tunes way into the late hours of the night.</p>

<p>Poor, talented Toby had a huge goose bump on the top of his head, I mean it looked like he'd been hit by the biggest cartoon baseball bat, yet he did nothing about it, except grow his hair long and nightly down a quart of whiskey while he played the most beautiful medieval guitar chords you'd ever heard.</p>

<p>He'd sneak into the antiquities sections of the UCSB library to get the real old classical music books.  These things were lined with gold! Seriously! Most of them were created by monks, some over 1,000 years ago.  And Toby would play the notes on his guitar, so sweet to the hears, tunes that hadn't been heard by human ears since the middle ages.</p>

<p>I guess that's how the tune got stuck in my head. Because when we laid it down as a background track for the first Finibus tour, I had no idea where it came from. Toby pointed it out to me later.  Verse x10o3. He'd been converting an old latin epic to structured chords. We called the song Epicurean Delights, and it had, shall we say, a certain addictive quality.  It made the girls go wild.</p>

<p>It always surprised me that a little tune, locked away for so many years could have become such a big hit. I mean, here's a series of notes that were as old as dirt, and they're topping the charts across the country.</p>

<p>Somehow I always felt we'd be a one hit wonder, so we lived things large, real large, right from the start. The reality of our success dawned on us about the time we rolled into Bakersfield.</p>

<p>The band had a spirit for adventure, since our flavor of dance hall reggae in Bakersfield was sort of like 2 Live Crew playing at Tipper Gore's bridge club. Finabus doesn't do any Buck Owens or Dwight Yoakam covers.</p>

<p>Regardlesss, the crowd was packed solid in that little road house bar, drenched in sweat as they jammed and pushed close to our stage and the deep base of our rock-steady base speaker.  We were a scene unto ourselves, a single crazy pulsing light in a wide desert of dry crops and quizzical cattle.</p>

<p>And this was an extra special night because my old friends Derek and Liam were there to join us on stage. Derek had moved back to the east coast and joined an ashram, and Liam, master of ska, was coming through Bakersfield with his band Easy Big Fella on their way to gig in LA. This was a performance we'd never forget, the stage diving, the love of the crowd, the star studied leather jackets and spiky stars flying over our heads on the twirling girls' cowboy boots. Good times in the heart of the dusty American dream.</p>

<p>That night I dreamt I saw the clearest night sky you can imagine, near infinite detail.  There's no way I could draw any of those star positions if you asked me now. I could maybe guess at the Milky Way and Orion, but in my sleepy mind I could somehow chart them all, as if some ancient memory were generating a crystal clear map from all the years my distant ancestors had made their way home under the same night sky.</p>

<p>When the front wheel chassis broke on a cattle gate in the road, we ended up trading the van to a farmer for his beat-up trailer and continued the rest of the tour in Toby's cousin's 1968 limo, our equipment lashed precariously on the trailer behind. Things were at a fever peak when we rolled into San Francisco that hot July night. That's when I met Tess, at a Berkley concert, except she wasn't there to see the show.  She was working on a large tapestry that hung near the entrance to the theater. I called her over to see if she could watch the trailer while we carried in the main woofer.</p>

<p>When I came back, Tess was lost in thought, sitting on the edge of the bumper, legs crossed and her finger stitching a pattern across the side of her leg.  I was transfixed. Her skin was a pale white, almost pearlescent and she had the coolest freckles across her shoulders and down her back.</p>

<p>Tess was a textile major at the time, doing some of the first digital fabric design using computers to create patterns that blew your mind. Tess was pushing the limits, merging 3D images using a new camera being developed by a friend in the science lab. The result was a dense, ever changing tapestry of fractal shapes and designs. Some days I'd just stare into the threads, lost in a maze that was crazy up-close, but even more jaw dropping from across the room. Each swirl combined with others to form whole universes of color that changed as we walked from side-to-side.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was floored when she made the band's cloaks out of her finest roll of the new material.  We felt like royalty, brothas from another planet.</p>

<p>I must admit - The common thread of my happiest <!--BFE--> memories was the glow and high after a really good show.   The feeling that we really were a great band, doing the right thing.   So many late nights, laughing at and reveling in the silliness of this great adventure. <!--- Leigh, Big Fish Ensembel--></p>
	
<p>From coast to coast, station to station, we traveled the world, avoiding airplanes whenever possible. The nights we spent adrift at sea were among my favorite. Here now, off the coast of Tripelee, the band snoozed on our way to Italy as waves lulled us to sleep.
</p>

<p>Tess held me all night, the movement of the boat rocked us to sleep.
Some time around 3am as the boat swayed, she whispered softly in my ear in her sleep, "nam liber tempor cum soluta nobis eleifend option congue nihil imperdiet doming id quod mazim placerat facer possim assum. Typi non habent claritatem insitam; est usus legentis in iis qui facit eorum claritatem."</p>

<p>Such an odd chant, hypnotic like a James Joyce novel. Tess's Latin was way better than mine, so good that she could recite it in her sleep. Weird.</p>

			Years later, when I realized Tess had been reciting Lorem Ipsum, I told Derek 
			about the weird incident. Derek's design group at FitBit didn't use placeholder text anymore. We pondered what had replaced that core repetition? What patterns still occurred across the entire spectrum?  Patterns of coding? The rhythm of the news cycle? 
			</p>

			<p>
			Was there something unique to the moral lesson of Lorem Ipsum that made it unique to this planet? Pulled by the moon, a fractured orb called Earth where only those with a firm will survived? Or did the repeating and mutating pattern mean nothing, just more noise in an otherwise slow fade into planetary oblivion.
