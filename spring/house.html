<h1>Dark Structure<br>
</h1>

<p>She went into the house, but she never left the house. Now we were aiming to find that house, or whatever might be left, to find clues.</p>

<p>We have to get back to that core house. If it had a lock on it in that early stage of the memory chip formation, there's something significant there. Would it still be standing, or would we even recognize it.  Whatever or whereever it was, we had to get in and we had to come to understand the code.</p>

<p>Author note: The "structure" dreams would evolve from writing code for an underground train, to a twisted old house with missing floors and lots of grey wood with dark towering spaces, until eventually the space was reborn as a cathedral space when spring arrived.  and desire for the female form was unleashed without guilt, only pure appreciation and a admittedly some desire.</p>
