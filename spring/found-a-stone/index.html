<div class=WordSection1>

<p>From pre-history, we move forward to 1603.  A young European
man, Piet Hein, is peering through the jungle, watching a Conquistador talk to
a native man.  The native man says, &#8220;Why are you here conquistador? You take
our gold, you take our women, what more do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the stone.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;What stone?&#8221; the native man replies. </p>

<p>&#8220;The Memory Stone&#8221; says the conquistador.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s not here. It’s already gone.&#8221; Lifting his gaze and
looking into the distance, several ships are seen disappearing over the
horizon.</p>

<p>The Dutch man watching from the jungle is a young Piet
Hein.  The Spanish man hears him move and soon Piet is caught.  As a captive he
is put to work as a galley-slave, where he learns Spanish.  Later he is swapped
in a prisoner trade and returns to the Netherlands where he tells a group of
wealthy Dutch investors the stories of the memory stone.  With their funding he
assembles a Dutch armada to capture the Spanish Silver fleet off the coast of
Cuba.</p>

<p>But finding the stone alludes him.  Without finding it,
Captain Hein lets the Spanish sailors go.  The Spanish walk to Havana as he
returns to the Netherlands with the gold.  The stone had been held in the beak
of a bird high above in the trees while the men were searched.</p>

<p>Back to the present day, several families are walking on the
beach.  Two young boys find the stone in the sand.  One boy’s father, Willem,
immediately recognizes it.  The older boy’s mother, Tess, asks what they’ve
found.  </p>

<p>On closer inspection, the stone the boys found does not look
like the one Willem thought he recognized from his reading of Piet's journal.</p>

<p>CHOOSE</p>

<p>As an interactive series, you get to choose the type of
Memory Stone! Please select one of the following to determine your path.</p>

<p>The Memory Stone the boy has found is…</p>

<p>A cheap piece of costume jewelry</p>

<p>A thumb-drive storage device from the future</p>

<p>A vessel containing the blood of Christ</p>

<p>A large ring found behind a gay bar in Anderson, SC</p>

<p>A smaller stone than the one Piet described, with a
different rune</p>

<p>As Willem stares at the sand falling through the stone I his
hand, he briefly has a flashback of Coda handing it to Loka. &#8220;The memory stone&#8221;
utters Willem, staring at the stone is in the palm of his hand.  Tess is more
skeptical than Willem, &#8220;Oh, come on, it’s just old jewelry.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8221; he says to Tess, this is the same stone.</p>

<p>Willem met Tess after moving to Atlanta, she’s a film
producer.  The couple has two children.  The family is on location doing
preliminary work for a video production.  Tess is the producer of an upcoming
Reality TV show about a group of scientists celebrating the Mayan New Year on a
Caribbean island.  The seemingly heady subject has proven to be especially
popular with the public in light of all the recent focus on the Mayan 5,000
year calendar.  </p>

<p>They are accompanied to the location by several coworkers. 
Most also have families along.  With only a week before the show airs, the
group has come to the Caribbean islands of Tortola and the adjacent Virgin
Gorda to finalize arrangements.  Every December 31, hundreds of boats are
lashed together in the bay at Tortola while New Year’s Eve celebrants walk from
deck to deck.  This year the boats are arriving early, on Dec 21 to celebrate
the Mayan New Year.</p>

<p>That evening as they pass the round stone around the camp
fire, Willem tells the group the story of his experience in the hospital as a
teenager.  He describes seeing himself across time, he talks about Coda, a girl
he saw again today when he first held the stone.  The group is dismissive,
&#8220;it’s just a dream honey&#8221;, says Tess.</p>

<p>Willem shares the story with parent to the travel group. 
She’s a professor from Warwick University in England </p>

<p>She tells him about the research with nano-rings they’ve
been doing in the lab.  &#8220;Quantum doughnuts&#8221; as we like to call them -
formations created accidentally when one of the grad students overcooked
quantum dots being prepared for another experiment.  Quantum doughnuts have the
ability to hold and capture light when specific magnetic harmonies are applied
– effectively acting as tiny black holes.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Willem calls his old girlfriend
Jena, waking her up, excitedly talking about the stone.  This time Jena is more
attentive.  </p>

<p>But she is also about to be in a rush.</p>

<p>Willem also attended UCSB.</p>

<p>Willem read the memoirs of Piet Hein in the antiquities
library at UC Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>.  She typically dismissed his half-science, half metaphysical
rants when they were students.  This time Jena is very attentive.</p>

<p>After they return from their travels, Willem sees that Rachel
will be in Atlanta for a conference.</p>

<p>&#8220;There’s something I have to show you&#8221; she says.  &#8220;Bring the
stone with you when you come.&#8221; </p>

<p>Capturing information and emitting it later by changing the
surrounding electro-magnetic field?  If a nano-sized doughnut could capture and
store light, what could one the size of one the size of the stone contain?</p>

<p><span style='font-size:9.0pt;color:#DBE5F1'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>From a page about &#8220;quantum doughnut&#8221; research at Warwick
University:  Remarkably the Warwick led research team have found that if a
combination of magnetic and electric fields is applied to these nano-rings they
can then simply tune the electric field to freeze an exciton in place or let it
collapse and re-emit a photon.  This video with scientists spreading jelly on
quantum doughnut with chocolate bars is better than a Saturday Night Live
skit…  <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/news/quantumdoughnuts">http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/news/quantumdoughnuts</a></p>
