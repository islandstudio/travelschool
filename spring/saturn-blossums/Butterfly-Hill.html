Though it is the dry season, there are several different species of asters, salvias, and lupines that are still in flower in the areas around the monarch colonies.  This story sounds very fantasy-based so I'm not sure how important it is to you to be scientifically or botanically accurate.  If so, pollen comes from the male parts of flowers, the stamens, or more specifically the anthers.  The pistol is the female part of a flower and does not produce pollen - http://www.amnh.org/learn/biodiversity_counts/ident_help/Parts_Plants/parts_of_flower.htm.  Also, ferns and fungi would be releasing spores, not pollen.

Hi Kim, Here’s the opening scene...

A group of families and two guides are ascending a path toward a jungle covered hill in Mexico.  The group is hot as they wind their way from the sun into the forest.  A pregnant woman is hiking with her husband and their 4 year old daughter.  The heat of the climb has her exhausted.  Her shirt says, JPL Cassini Deep Space.

The woman sighs and pauses, glad to be out of the sun.  She looks at her husband with mild frustration.  Their eyes turn up the path to their daughter, several paces in front of them as she turns slowly around, looking up at the trees with awe. The surrounding forest is covered in monarch butterflies.  Their daughter smiles and the mood of the parents lightens as they watch her put her hands in the air and twirl around.  A group of butterflies takes flight.

The camera view spins through the trees.  We hear a soft, instrumental version of the Magical Mystery Tour starting up.  It’s a gentle sweeping version, more like George Harrison would perform than the heavier beat of the original.

The view widens.  We follow the group of butterfly up through the trees until the full valley and surrounding mountains are behind them.  The shot follows the butterflies over a nearby village in the valley below. 

Three native teenager girls are carrying round, earthen pots near their bellies, smiling and laughing.  As the young women walk through the village, butterflies are landing on buildings, plants and a tour bus.

We see a close-up of a butterfly landing on a flower at the edge of the forest.  A puff of yellow pollen is shaken from the pistol and fills the air around it.  The camera’s focal point shifts to the child behind the flower.  She’s watching the butterfly intently. The hand of the father rests on the pregnant woman’s hand as they watch their child from up the trail.  The camera narrows in on the couple’s hands.  She moves their entwined fingers over the curve of her pregnant belly.

The camera cuts to the hand of one of the three girls in the village, which wraps around the pot she carries like one would hold a pregnant belly.  Each pot is painted with bands of light and dark that resemble the planet Saturn.  Each is perfectly spherical with a hexagonal opening.

As the three women reach the center of their small village the sun is setting.  Each tosses the pot they are carrying forward into a circular courtyard at the center of the village.

The three pots impact each other from the sides, starting a circular motion.  The pieces shatter, mix and collide.  

The camera moves upward, turning slowly above the courtyard as the pieces tumble across the ground in slow motion.  From the central point of impact they form a ripple of motion, bouncing upward and then spreading outward in smaller, bouncing ripples.  They move to the raised edge of the courtyard’s circle, rebound and form a slight ripple back inward from the edge.

&#8220;Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour, step right this way.&#8221;  The camera widens outward from the circle in the village, clouds, sunset and mountains.

We hear the four year old girl laughing and see a shower of pollen as hundreds of butterflies alight on the flowers.  The pregnant woman smiles.  The camera follows the butterflies through the trees as the last rays of sun begin to filter through.

Dusk is falling and the group is descending from the mountains.

The camera again goes wide over the valley as night falls.  The stars are magnificent.  From above the earth we see the winding arm of a hurricane approaching the Mexico coast.

Scene two…

Rain is falling on a window in a house in the Mexican village as ambient swirling sounds blend into a phone ringing.  A woman’s hand reaches for an iPad phone to click an &#8220;Answer&#8221; button.

A male voice whispers, &#8220;Jenni, wake up, Saturn is blossoming.&#8221;  The image on the iPad shows the planet Saturn.  Tiny hurricanes follow a hexagon-shaped path around the north pole.


Kim, what types of local flowers would fit into the storyline where the pollen fills the air?  Or is there a fungus or fern in the area which is more likely to cast up pollination particles?

Thanks, hope your travels are going wonderfully.  -Loren
