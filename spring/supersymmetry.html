But if ATLAS really saw something, it’s something decidedly unusual, the researchers report. If an experiment produces the standard model’s version of the Higgs boson, only one in 100,000 of them will decay into two photons. The signal at ATLAS is 30 times bigger than the standard model predicts, meaning either they produced 30 times more Higgs bosons than expected, or 30 in 100,000 of them turned into two photons.

The purported signal could be a signature of supersymmetry, an extension of the standard model in which every particle has a &#8220;superpartner&#8221; that differs only in a quantum mechanical property called spin. Or it could be a particle that goes beyond the standard model altogether. One candidate is a hypothetical particle called the radion, which is associated with extra dimensions.

&#8220;Everybody wants to see something that takes us beyond the standard model,&#8221; Gillies said. &#8220;Finding a standard-model Higgs at the LHC … from a physics perspective it would be quite a boring thing. There’s a lot of hope and expectation that we can find something beyond the standard model.&#8221;
