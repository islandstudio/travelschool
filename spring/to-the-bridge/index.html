<p>2011-07-23 Carried me to the bridge</p>

<p>Willem has a dream while leading a Travel School course in the
Yucatan…</p>

<p><a href="http://dreamstudio.com/mayabridge">Maya Bridge</a></p>

<p>I awoke with the sudden rush of awareness.  The flowing
bands of DNA-like strands were not you and me, it was you and [Teresa].  It was
the strength of two women and all women.  It made perfect sense, the braiding,
spinning double helix was femininity, and I was the agent of creation and
destruction.  For the first time, my foot alighted firmly on the bridge guided
by your form.  From out of the water the towering waves of life sprung
infinitely upward and outward.  The bridge was both contemporary and ancient. 
Your combined strength placed me there. You were the cat, agile and twisting.
And I was the bird, chattering and aligned only by your grace.  How foolish of
me to think that I was holding you in my flight, that we alone were the only
ones in flight.  </p>

<p>Foot on the bridge, hand on your form, now I saw that the
flowing hair emanated from not just two beings, but from many more. It was the
path of life, connecting everything born as one solid flow – combining in the trunk
of the present – held in the now and spreading outward in all directions. 
Strands intertwined, and connected to a zillion more rising from the water
below – the past from which your roots sprung.  Your hair flowed outward to
futures we had not yet traversed, with patterns were instantly knowable across
all time.  In one heart-felt leap, I spun with my arm around your combined
trunk, outward and over the river of life below.  I was one with the true tree
of life and all its power.  Here I, the outsider, here I the male, held tight
to all inception, to all birth and to all death simultaneously.  And in that
moment the evolution to winged man had begun.  To man united with grace.</p>

<p>Austen [or Kali] came to me yesterday as we were preparing to
leave and said, &#8220;Dad what if there was a superhero who used his hair as his
super power.  What if it was like Spiderman’s web, and it could grow for
swinging from building to building?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Would he need to cut it off each
time, or would it just continue to grow?&#8221;  We were crouched on the floor
surrounded by hundreds of Abbeys Barbie dolls, some very old 70’s dolls handed
down from Terri and her sister.  Cher was in my hands, and Wonder Woman was in
Abbey’s hands.  Abbey had just asked me if we should trim Wonder Woman’s crazy
kinky flowing hair, and I’d said, &#8220;No, let it grow, it’s where she gets her
power from.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you confirmed to me that you were my muse now, like
you’d been for many others when I first knew you, it felt like a slight because
I knew you were much more.  I had to make the leap to catch you before our
connection escaped me.  I clung to you and now you’ve carried me to the bridge,
standing there firmly only briefly to gain perspective, before leaping back
into your spinning eternity.  Consciousness held flow in its arms.  I could see
that you were one, and I could see the strength of your connection to earth and
sky.  This is something new for you because you have not always had a strong
connection to other women.  You’ve been disconnected and a drift like I am from
men.  I’m reaching to embrace you and reconnect you with the whole.</p>

<p>From here the next step for me is to head down the tree to
its roots, to explore where it meets the water’s edge.  I have to learn about
the destructive forces that tore asunder the relationship between my father and
my mother.  I hope to find more clues in Kitty Hawk.  Wait a second, Kitty
Hawk, Bird Jaguar.  Bird Jaguar, Kitty Hawk. Both a bird and a cat.  Weird.</p>

<p>Why is Kitty Hawk significant to me?  When I was four years
old my mother, father and I came here from Illinois to camp by the beach,
pulling our small blue tent-camper behind the Pontiac.  We nestled our camper
in the sandy campsite among the trees.  My mom caught a crab off the pier,
using a chicken head as bait.  It chattered and changed a rainbow of hues as
she boiled it without heating the water beforehand.  Rat-ta-tat-tat-tat, it’s
tiny claws clattered for life in the aluminum pan over the camp stove.  That
night, 70 mile-an-hour winds buffeted our tent as a hurricane blew near, only
miles from shore.  My dad moved slowly through the storm, his 6’1&#8221; form hunched
against the wind for stability, rope in hand lashing our tent camper to the
surround trees, and I said &#8220;Big Wind, Big Wind, Big Wind&#8221; over and over again.</p>

<p>What I remember most fondly about Kitty Hawk is the tall
hill that towers over the area where Wilbur and Orville took flight.  Shaped
like a Mayan pyramid, it rises high above the beach and water below.  A hill of
steep grass, perfect for a child to climb and tumble down.  It’s hard not to
share this with Patrick now, but we will have many hills to climb and tumble on
in the years to come.  And you will tell him the story of Bird Jaguar so he
knows the legend woven from the fibers of the love around him.</p>

<p>When you come in the fall, we will plant corn in the
tradition of Demeter the daughter of Persephone.  We will dance in the moon
light.</p>

<p>Austen said he dreamed about two pirates kids on a beach
trying to steal a treasure chest buried in the sand from two guards. He didn't
know who the other boy was with him - maybe your son. One of the boys
distracted the guards while the other boy dragged the treasure to their ship
which was anchored just off the shore. I told him there would be a pirate
museum in Kitty Hawk, he didn't know before the dream.</p>

<p>Terri said to me yesterday that Austen and I should be in a
band together, father and son.  Perhaps the winged bird men with hair of gold;
chattering, chattering at your window bold.</p>

<p>A man on the street, says &#8220;come to me&#8221; to a woman, &#8220;I will
make things better.&#8221;  He is a fool because he is selfish, he seeks disruption
rather than balance.  But the surrounding community forces his hand.  He cannot
unite families under the rules of our society.  He can only remove a father
from a son. That’s the disruption that led my mother to leave my dad, and her
mother to leave her prior husband.  My mother – torn loose by a fellow jogger
who managed a factory that made car windows.  My grandmother – glimpsed by my
grandfather Eugene, a car salesman who saw her walk past the glass showroom
window of a Packard dealership in Detroit.  Simply put, a relation of two will
always create a polarity, a discontent.   The problem is when we overlook the
forming minds of the children within the relationships.  The ripping energy is
immortal, but with the right story telling mechanism the fabric for balance is
introduced.  Matriarchal groups have maintained this balance and stability for
eons, to protect and raise children.</p>

<p>I have decided that I will introduce you as my Adopted
Sister. Have a wonderful Saturday my sweet muse of forgotten memories. ;)</p>

<p>2011-07-23 (altered to fit the story line)</p>

<p>Willem receives a post from an old friend while teaching at
the travel school. Oddly, the post asks if he's gay.</p>

<p>Hi, I just saw your message.  The answer’s no, but I
appreciate the openness of your question and your bravery to ask.</p>

<p>We’re going to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina next.  Wanna come
join us with your family?  </p>

<p>I’ve had your account blocked for a few months because I get
pulled to respond to the generally one-sided posts.  I like the heated discussion, but I work too hard to defend
issues when they appear in front of my cohorts.  I’m sorry I missed this when
you posted it.</p>

<h2>How shapes and desire interact</h2>

<p>I had this amazing vision early one morning of a cross made out of
fractals.  The center line of the cross was the center parts of women’s bodies
in fractal forms - cleavage, vagina.  All the shapes that drive lust.  The arms
of the cross were outstretched and they embraced me.  I was at the same time,
five years old being embraced through the fence in our backyard by the girl who
lived behind us.  This dream was all about being accepted by church and
community, from whom I’ve felt rejected since my mom divorced my dad when I was
5.</p>

<p>[The following was repeated – but the context of an email to
a friend who has just confessed a deep secret might be an interesting way to
introduce Bird Jaguar.]</p>

<p>Journal from 2011-06-29 - The Head of Bird Jaguar</p>

<p>&#8220;What’s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The head of Bird Jaguar&#8221;</p>

<p>A Lacandona legend tells that when the head of Bird Jaguar
returns to its site, the world will be devastated by celestial jaguars.</p>

<p>I friend sent me this to watch soon:</p>

<p>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/cracking-maya-code.html</p>


<hr>

<p>O'Connell makes me very proud to be a UCSB alumni.</p>

<p>About our crew - This isn’t a team who can just talk about
ideas, this is the best and brightest at actually creating. In today’s world of
fabrication, what can we create, orchestrate and implement from the deck of a
boat? How can we do so affordably, sustainably, with universal benefits?</p>


<p>So "I think I am going to go to finance, because at least they compensate you monetarily there." O'Connell said shortly before leaving UCSB.</p>

<p>I tracked him down in the Silcon Valley years later where he and his girl friend were
	software developers, working on their own version of Trello.</p>

<p>O'Connell - Breakthrough of the Year: Bridging the
Quantum and the Classical Worlds</p>

<p>http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2010_12_17/caredit.a1000120</p>

<p>"At the bars, when I talk to people, no one's ever said, 'Oh yeah, I know who you are,' or, 'That thing that you're talking about is interesting.' "</p>

<p>Our crew knew who O'Connell was. We wouldn't be gathered here today, at the bar, had it not been for his early work.</p>



<p>Iron and Wine: Each Coming Night</p>

<p>Photons split and inhabit individual lives, returning to one
in the end. Which end is lonelier?</p>

<p>When I heard Dylan say that he would likely leave his
quantum research to work on Wall Street, because there was no money in Physics,
my heart fell a notch. As a culture we need to reward and celebrate the great
creative minds that are taking us to the new frontiers of science. That’s why
we created… (to be added)</p>

<p>Physicists are describing the way we experience memory when
they describe string theory. Our thoughts go back in time momentarily when
recalling an event. The experience is not typically one we are aware of, but in
dream-state that recall becomes a reality in its own right. And we are jarred
back to the present when we drift deeply into a dream thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever we awake, we have the propensity to be in a new
universe. But most of us are too ensnarled and confused to escape the present.
I was living in two at the same time. One foot on the boat, the other on the
bridge. Torn.&#8221; - Dylan Knife</p>

<p>Dylan, always the incurable tinkerer, couldn’t resist the
ultimate test of his new quantum invention. If a tiny piece of metal could be
sent into a magnetic dance, residing in two places at once. Why couldn’t a
human? Calculating what it would take to achieve near zero temperature rapidly
enough in the large vacuum chamber in the tunnel under the UCSB Physics Lab,
Dylan devised an ingenious pivoting vacuum door to spin a human volunteer into
the dark void of the large chamber fast enough to remove all air while his core
temperature was dropped to near zero in a fraction of a second. Fast enough to
slow all his molecular movement simultaneously to avoid damage.</p>

<p>Then as the door swung shut in an instance of spinning super
freezing, the moment of unexpected, unpredictable happened. Like a knife, the
vibration shook my crystalizing body, sending a wave that shook my torso with a
sudden force and in one swift twist split my divine holiness into two halves,
one tumbling into the past, the other accelerating into the future with a
sudden woosh of awareness. At least that’s how it felt to me, the guys and
Sarah back at the lab were not so fortunate. For in that moment, that past
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>And there on the floor lay my crystal skull, eyes peering
out with the consciousness of the universe. Missing only a body. Potential with
no action. Dreams and action forever split.</p>

should we?</p>

<p>Okay, sorta mentions the singularity. Baby ‘ll make this
work. A trying song.</p>

<p>Chapter title: Cry Singularity</p>

<p>Perfect song: Alex Murdoch – Song For You – Time Without
Consequence</p>

<p>All of this land moves around you.</p>

<p>You are moving too.</p>

<p>2010-07-02 Watched history show abut pirates in Anderson</p>

<p>1715 - Spanish Silver Fleet sunk by hurricane off coast of
Florida.</p>

<p>Note added 7/21/2011 Cool coincidence: </p>

<p>My mom is given coins for this sinking a week later - from a
new friend she meets with a metal detector on the beach.</p>

<p>Like these: http://www.newworldtreasures.com/1715-fleet.htm</p>

<p>Pirate Henery James/Genings - each pirate earned 10 years’
salary in one night. Go to form the island country of Nassau when Jamaica
rejects them.</p>

<p>Black Beard’s decapitated head hung from ship of South
Carolina colony troop ship.</p>

<p>Anne Bonnie is the next pirate sensation after Black Beard.</p>

<p>In an earlier in time, Dutch Privateer Piet Hein captured an
earlier Spanish Silver fleet in 1628…</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Pieterszoon_Hein</p>

<p>I identify with Piet, I have him on my family tree site:</p>

<p>http://familytrees.net/familytrees/heyns/</p>

<p>I’d like to follow the path of how the captured Spanish Gold
was spent.</p>

<p>Terrisa joins up with Willem again in Kitty Hawk.  Putt-putt
golf. Find a strange stone on the beach (maybe).  Build the romance here.</p>

<p>Next stop Cumberland Island. (Maybe back in time to a young,
clumsy band of NC pirates hiding from the Spanish.)</p>
