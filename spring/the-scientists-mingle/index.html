<p>Hi Fayaz,</p>

<p>I’m curious what you think about this 2011 study.</p>

<p>A magnetic field is rotated around two individuals together
in a room.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The individuals are then separated.&nbsp; When one
individual is shown light flashes, the head of the other individual emits
photons.</p>

<p><a

<p>Similar experiments have demonstrated effects at distances
greater than 10 km.</p>

<p>A recent study mentioned in the intro found significant
increases in biophoton emission near the right hemisphere, but not the left,
for most volunteers when they sat in a dark room and imagined light compared to
simply casual thinking.</p>

<p>The concept of coherent long-range interactions in living
tissue was developed by Froehlich (1980) to provide a basis for the spatial and
temporal order of biological systems.</p>

<p>Here’s a 2010 study showing how brain 'entanglement' could
explain memories (full copy below):</p>

<p>One photon in pair is emitted by black holes in labs.</p>

<p><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Brain 'entanglement' could
explain memories</span></p>

<p>16:42 12 January 2010 by David Robson</p>

<p>Magazine issue 2743.</p>

<p>Subatomic particles do it. Now the observation that groups
of brain cells seem to have their own version of quantum entanglement, or
&quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;, could help explain how our minds
combine experiences from many different senses into one memory.</p>

<p>Previous experiments have shown that the electrical activity
of neurons in separate parts of the brain can oscillate simultaneously at the
same frequency – a process known as phase locking. The frequency seems to be a
signature that marks out neurons working on the same task, allowing them to
identify each other.</p>

<p>Dietmar Plenz and Tara Thiagarajan at the National Institute
of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, wondered whether more complicated
signatures also link groups of neurons. To investigate, they analysed neuronal
activity using arrays of electrodes implanted in the brains of two awake
macaque monkeys and embedded in dish-grown neuron cultures.</p>

<p>In both cases, the researchers noticed that the voltage of
the electrical signal in groups of neurons separated by up to 10 millimetres
sometimes rose and fell with exactly the same rhythm. These patterns of
activity, dubbed &quot;coherence potentials&quot;, often started in one set of
neurons, only to be mimicked or &quot;cloned&quot; by others milliseconds
later. They were also much more complicated than the simple phase-locked
oscillations and always matched each other in amplitude as well as in
frequency.</p>

<p>Perfect clones</p>

<p>&quot;The precision with which these new sites pick up on
the activity of the initiating group is quite astounding – they are perfect
clones,&quot; says Plenz.</p>

<p>Importantly, cloned signals only appeared after one region
had reached a threshold level of activity. Plenz likens this to the
&quot;tipping point&quot; in human societies when a trend becomes adopted by
large numbers of people. This threshold might ensure that our attention is only
captured by significant stimuli rather than by every single signal.</p>

<p>Since the coherence potentials seemed unique, each one could
represent a different memory Plenz suggests. Their purpose may be to trigger
activity in the various parts of the brain that store aspects of the same
experience. So a smell or taste, say might trigger a coherence potential that
then activates the same potential in neurons in the visual part of the brain.</p>

<p>Karl Friston at University College London calls the
discovery &quot;a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle&quot; in terms of brain
message transmission.</p>

<p>2011-05-16 Lizardly - polarized light detection</p>

<p>The study demonstrated better school test performance (10 to
20 percent) when students were exposed to daylight. </p>

<p><a
href="http://www.cashnet.org/resource-center/Section2/2-1-14.html">http://www.cashnet.org/resource-center/Section2/2-1-14.html</a></p>

<p>After talking last night, I was wondering if the third eye of
lizards detects motion or quick changes to light.  I was puzzled regarding
whether they would have a reflexive reaction.  I’ve concluded they would have a
&#8220;contemplative&#8221; reaction – accessing the situation before moving in response to
a change in overhead light.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia on the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuataralizard">Tuatara lizard</a>: &#8220;They are
further unusual in having a pronounced photo-receptive eye dubbed the
&quot;third eye&quot;… thought to be involved in setting circadian and seasonal
cycles. …The parietal eye is part of the pineal complex, another part of which
is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night.  It has been
shown that some salamanders use their pineal body to perceive <b>polarized
light</b>, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover,
aiding navigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think a fast reflexive reaction to a change in overhead
light would cause a lizard to jump too much.  It would get eaten if a bird flew
over it.  A lizard’s best response would be to use its two seeing eyes to
observe why the light hitting the third eye had changed.  Shadows from branches
are constantly shifting with the wind, so one needs to be able to tune out
&#8220;noise&#8221; signals.</p>

<p>Hence, I think the third I is primarily involved in slow
(subconsicious) processing of light information.</p>

<p>My own reaction to exposing the skull to light is a slight
tightening feeling in the center of my head.  For me, the process of
brainstorming feels like sending energy around rapidly in circles, kind of like
rapid eye movement.</p>

<p>Once I rollover in the morning and experienced a sudden
change in thought pattern.  Unsure why, I realized the shirt had fallen off my
head.  I went from dream thought to active thought.</p>

<p>Another time, I dreamt I was in a building suddenly hit by a
tornado, and I awoke suddenly feeling a squeeze in the center of my head. It
was as if adrenalin was being pumped into my body - perhaps the pineal gland
was being emptied.  (A flight or fight response.)  My head wasn’t covered at
the time, but I’d gotten a lot of sun that day and ate ice cream with
carrageenan that evening which can induce dreams – likely because carrageenan
causes tissue to swell.</p>

<p>I found that when failing to get enough sleep one night last
week (got up at 3am to work), I became less pineally aware the next few days.</p>

<p>I got some good sleep last night.  I’m feeling quick odd
that I’m the only person on earth who reports a feeling of relaxation when
putting on a hat.  (Well maybe not, fez hats are referred to as thinking caps.)  
One has to wonder if the &#8220;founding fathers&#8221; of democratic movements in France
and America where more creative wearing wigs.  (I’m being funny with that
observation.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Wide-ranging species, including insects, invertebrates and
vertebrates, have been demonstrated to have the ability to detect specific
polarities of ambient light. For example, <b>many of these animals can discern
the direction of light polarity</b>, utilizing it for functions such as
navigation, spatial orientation, object recognition and intraspecies
communication… humans have the ability to visually discriminate polarized
light, although they cannot detect the direction of polarity.&#8221; – From <a
href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3931/is_200006/ai_n8923437/">effects
of polarized light on melatonin regulation</a>.</p>

<p>If the pineal gland is triggered by Cryptochrome, and birds
use Cryptochrome to detect magnetic north using quantum vibration.  Then it
seems like the pineal gland could have other uses for spatial orientation and
creative thought.  How does this differ from polarized light detection?</p>

<p>2011-05-17 - Quantum soul searching</p>

<p>Got up real early and wrote the following:<br>
<br>
Hi Mark, I’m interested in being the den leader again since Andy is taking a
break.</p>

<p>Parents, if you opt to stick with me as your den leader,
please be advised that this year I’ll be including physics topics from the book
The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking.&nbsp; (Hawking basically declared that the
formation of the universe can be explained without a creator, and that physics
is gradually becoming more like metaphysics - with forces like quantum
entanglement inspiring the next generation of thought and soul searching.)</p>

<p><a

target="_blank">http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/05/entertainment/la-ca-stephen-hawking-20100905</a></p>

<p>My intention is to engage the boys in deeper discussion and
debate rather than glossing over topics to toe the line.&nbsp; As parents, you
are more than welcome to interject your views.&nbsp; Thankfully our troop also
has a second den for those interested in a more standard scouting experience.</p>

<p>I’m enthused about the year ahead and hope to bring on a few
new recruits by taking a more unconventional approach with our den.</p>

<p>I’d also like to let the boys design their own uniform this
year.&nbsp; We may end up with a more rugged uniform, less formal - more for
mountain climbing.</p>

<p><span style='font-size:9.0pt;color:#DBE5F1'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Mark writes:</p>

<p>Loren, thanks for your interest, and I applaud your resolve.
But David Scott has said he wants to take on all the Webelos next year, and the
executive committee said that would be fine. </p>

<p>If we end up having more Webelos than David can handle, then
perhaps we'll spin off another den. But for the moment, we need to stick with
one group. </p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he is looking for an
assistant, though.</p>

<p>-Mark</p>

<p>I respond:</p>

<p><span style='color:#1F497D'>Okay, I’ll pass on the offer to
assist, but thanks.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Now what I notice the next day after sitting by the window
for a couple hours, the little sun-squeeze doesn’t occur until I think about
this, about trying to make it work.  It’s like a painless migraine.  I put a
shirt on my head and I’m fine.  To be true to myself, I’m committed to stop the
fantasy, to be firmly science minded – to be truly open minded – following my
own beliefs rather than trying to use creativity to bend into a religious
belief system.  For me that’s a false creativity, and I need to focus on my own
path to understanding.  Hence, we picked up The Grand Design as my birthday
gift at the book store last night.  And my first Led Zeppelin CD.</p>

<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.5pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>

<p style='border:none;padding:0in'>I suspect at the core level,
if you worship the sun, you are about taking life.  In an ecosystem full of
abundant energy, forces expand enmass and consume.  The sun is filling, the moon
is nurturing.  I’m thinking about the flip in Ancient Egypt. A sun god is one
god – appropriate for expansion and acquisition of countries.  Balance is found
by embracing plurality after conquest, because systems will naturally gravitate
to decentralization – many local Gods in the pantheon of the powerful ruling
entity.</p>

<p style='border:none;padding:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2011-05-17 Sleep cap and light polarity - hit snag</p>

<p>The light shining through my window at night is a
fluorescent street lamp which emits polarized light.  Polarized light regulates
sleep inducing melatonin, BUT SO DOES non-polarized light according to the
first study below!  It’s a study through the eyes.  So my only hope to salvage
this is if polarized light acts differently through the cranium – which would
mean that maybe the pineal gland is effected by the direction of the polarity.</p>

<p>A sleep cap has been effective at allowing me to sleep
deeper than just a sleep mask does when I’m under the light of the fluorescent
street lamp.</p>

<p>How is it that light hitting my head can have an effect on
my sleep?</p>

<p>Some salamanders use their pineal body to perceive <b>polarized
light</b>, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover,
aiding navigation.  Am I part lizard?</p>

<p>The study <a
href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3931/is_200006/ai_n8923437/">effects
of polarized light on melatonin regulation</a> states that many animals can
discern the direction of light polarity, utilizing it for functions such as
navigation, spatial orientation, object recognition and intraspecies
communication.  It goes on to say that humans have the ability to visually
discriminate polarized light, although they cannot detect the direction of
polarity.</p>

<p>But wait, an optical effect called Haidinger's brushes does
in fact allow people to determine the direction of polarity of computer screens
and light at sunset and sunrise.  It’s noticeable by tilting our heads.  The
image here looks a little like your Facebook profile Fayez: <a
href="http://world.std.com/~mmcirvin/haidinger.html">http://world.std.com/~mmcirvin/haidinger.html</a></p>

<p>Have we been naïvely assume light absorption in humans
occurs only through the eyes?  Our eyes lack the Cryptochrome molecules of
birds, it resides in our pineal gland instead.  (More about <a
href="http://clearsci.blogspot.com/2011/01/sos-save-our-science-cryptochrome-lord.html">Cryptochrome,
Lord of time</a>)</p>

<p>As weird as it sounds, I’ve found that wearing a hat allows
me to focus more creatively during the day.</p>

<p>The study demonstrated better school test performance (10 to
20 percent) in classes with daylight. </p>

<p><a
href="http://www.cashnet.org/resource-center/Section2/2-1-14.html">http://www.cashnet.org/resource-center/Section2/2-1-14.html</a></p>

<p>But if these kids are in the daylight, wouldn’t they focus
less?  Ah ha, the kids in the study were not sitting directly in the sun. 
Daylight illuminating a classroom loses its polarity as it reflects of
surfaces.   In contrast, fluorescent light hits the students directly. 
Polarized light will keep one awake and alert, but it may also inhibit
creative, focused thought and problem solving.</p>

<p>If you want a child to think deeply, send them into a forest
where sunlight filters through the trees.<br><br>

<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>I did a lot of research on filters....ideally, I would love
a whole house system, but those are expensive. The two options I think are good
are multipure under the sink systems (this is the one that does both the carbon
filtration and reverse osmosis for flouride):
http://www.multipureco.com/mpro.htm</p>

<p>I would like to get one of these with the zero waste system
attached (RO can use and waste a lot of water) but it is a bit pricey to do the
whole package. </p>

<p>So, what we use is a Berkey water filter--carbon filtration
with their flouride filters. You can read quite a bit about them online. What is
nice is you don't need a complicated system it is a gravity filter/countertop
but eliminates a very large number of contaminants, pesticides, chlorine,
arsenic, flouride. The filters last at least a year. you can even take it
traveling/camping because it is mobile. I ordered from More than Alive which is
in Tennessee and the closest very reputable dealer from us--it arrived in 2
days. Right now I use a combination of the Berkey filter and then some RO water
from Sevananda or Whole Foods when I go there. I have heard that the Berkey
water retains a few more minerals etc than pure RO water so I like to mix it
up. </p>

melatonin production.</p>

<p>Reduced melatonin has been linked to scoliosis.</p>

<p>The easiest way to increase natural melatonin production is

<p>2011-06-08 - Steering electrons</p>

<p>Chaos is the source of intelligent design.</p>

<p>If asked to visualize a light, the right side of the brain
is used.</p>

<p>But how about a horizontal vertical floresant tube?  Feels
like the left side of the brain to me, with its longer lateral fold.</p>

<p>06-09-2011  With my new haircut and no sleep cap, sitting
here in the morning I can feel the external electromagnetic energy, like a
music that is too loud.   But it’s not uncomfortable.  Just something we are
not normally aware of.  We attribute it to our own mind and feelings of
wakefulness.</p>

<p>06-10-2011   I left my sleep cap off and the symbol man
presented me a stylized image of the sun (with rays like the Tree of Life).  If
I’m well rested, I don’t get the little squeeze feeling without it.  </p>

<p>Thought of the day</p>

<p>Christ killed God, or rather &#8220;reinvented&#8221; God.  Religion is
so steeped in conflict between fathers and sons.  Christ drank God’s blood and
nullified 10,000 years of animal sacrifice ritual.  Soon animals were no longer
given to the priests.  Christ was the first member of the &#8220;me&#8221; generation,
eventually leading to the advent of Burger King.</p>

<p>It’s either fascinating or disturbing how nature has succeed
at creating bonds and obligations between family members.</p>

<p>The solar wind blows outward at a million miles per hour.
When it reaches the edge of the surrounding heliosphere, a magnetic bubble more
than 6.2 billion miles wide, it does what? Forms more bubbles!</p>

<p>Excerpts from NASA press conference: Because the sun spins,
its magnetic field becomes twisted and wrinkled, a bit like a ballerina's
skirt. Far, far away from the sun, where the Voyagers are, the folds of the
skirt bunch up.  When charged particles escape the heliopause (a sea of bubbles
with fingers and indentations) and access the field lines that connect back to
the Sun, they quickly escape along the magnetic field lines back to the sun,
very much like entering a highway.  Galactic cosmic rays slowly wander into the
heliosphere from outside, and can get trapped in the sea of magnetic bubbles.
Eventually they also access the solar magnetic field lines that connect back to
the sun, and can move quickly towards the sun and Earth.</p>

<p>So virtual photons travel outward from our brains and become
entrapped in the porus bubbles of other living matter’s DNA.  Eventually our
virtual photons find their way back, along with virtual photons from others
(the equivalent of cosmic rays).  Overall, the mass of our experiences is
increasing, as is the solar system and planet.  We let go of matter during
dreams as we convert experience to the symbolic, it moves up a dimension. 
Recollections come back to us as conscious thought and symbols.</p>

<p>2011-06-11  It’s 4 at night, only faint traces of light in
the downstairs room.  The black polyester track shorts come off my head and I’m
seeing moving psychedelic shapes this time.  Granted, they are still largely
faint colors on a black background, but they are moving.  I can feel the sinus
sounds crackling in my head.  Maybe I rolled over, so shifting bran fluids
could be at play here, or changing polarity.  Three factors have combined.  The
need to go pee (which often coincides with an early morning symbol related to
something previously on my mind), an evening at the pool and ice cream.  I’m
also dehydrated, so I’m up to get some water.</p>

<p>I ask the dream mind, who’s in my 5 year old dream, instant
response &#8220;Terri and the kids.&#8221;</p>

<p>2011-06-12 Nostril Advice for Programmers</p>

<p>If you’re having difficulty focusing on a
technical/anaylitcal task, take a second to check what nostril is currently
open.  Nostils alternate every few hours.  A series of three erectile tissues
constrict one side and then the other. If your left nostril is currently open,
then your right-brain is currently flooded with blood.  You’re in creative
mode, switch to a design task until your circadian rythim cycles back to
programming mode.  Or go read an article on the Drudge Report to get your
vinegar up and back to attack mode (left brain).</p>

<p>The left side of your brain has a longer lateral fold than
the right side.  Hence, it act more like an arrow.  Direct, cause-effect
thinking.  In contrast, right brain kicks in after you eat.  It’s more
scattered, in defensive-creative mode.  Watching for attack as you digest your
food.  It’s more big picture.  A vertical fold breaks up the directness of the
right-brain, causing it to weigh options and think more about the big picture.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I shift from programming to laying out
the HTML of the new DreamStudio site.  The first design update in eight years.</p>
