<p>I saw Spring today. And I dreamt a dream.</p>

<p>A television show was going over cards received in the mail from world spiritual leaders.  Five or Six were shown along with the authors - priests, rabbis, shaikhs, all acknowledging the occurance of some commonly significant event. (Nelson Mandella had just died, but this was also tied to a seasonal change - winter solstice was nearing.)</p>

<p>Oddly, my Dad, Loren (me), had been grouped in among these leaders. His image appeared briefly as he walked somewhere outside. There was a humor to his inclusion.</p>

And there was this new substance. A green powder/liquid that glowed brightly. (I'd watched a video about biking on corn starch.)

My Dad knew it was a vision seeking compound.

He was in a church like building. It's somehow the same building as the dilapidated, mixed-up old house under rehabiliation that has tormented my dreams on several occasions, but now it's a finished cathedral - still old dark and beautiful, but now also magnificent.  He's taking the green glowing powder as some of the world leaders move slowly through the church, and he's blowing it on the older hispanic man, annointing him.

It is, perhaps, this older man's wedding.  And soon they are laughing and turning at a slight angle, rotating while turning, and floating off the ground up into the air within this church while smiling and knowing. The other spiritual leaders in front of them are looking back.  There is no concern or disaapointment in their expressions, only appreciation and understanding.

This Hispanic man, he was a migrant worker during his life, from the juguar people.

He his, perhaps, 50. Slightly pudgy. One wonders if he is the father of the bride.

I'm thinking about Coda now, the Jaguar Princess.  It's almost 3am. Our dog Myla woke up the house for the second evening in a row, barking. She's normally such a quite dog. Probably a cat on the porch. Jumping and turning below where I sleep, like Coda moving through the trees.
