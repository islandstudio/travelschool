'>A group of families and two guides are ascending a path toward a
jungle covered hill in Mexico.&nbsp; The group is hot as they wind their way
from the sun into the forest.&nbsp; A pregnant woman is hiking with her husband
and their 4 year old daughter.&nbsp; The heat of the climb has her
exhausted.&nbsp; Her shirt says, JPL Cassini Deep Space.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>The woman sighs and pauses, glad to be out of the sun.&nbsp; She
looks at her husband with mild frustration.&nbsp; Their eyes turn up the path
to their daughter, several paces in front of them as she turns slowly around,
looking up at the trees with awe. The surrounding forest is covered in monarch
butterflies.&nbsp; Their daughter smiles and the mood of the parents lightens
as they watch her put her hands in the air and twirl around.&nbsp; A group of
butterflies takes flight.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>The camera view spins through the trees.&nbsp; We hear a soft,
instrumental version of the Magical Mystery Tour starting up.&nbsp; It’s a
gentle sweeping version, more like George Harrison would perform than the
heavier beat of the original.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>The view widens.&nbsp; We follow the group of butterflies up
through the trees until the full valley and surrounding mountains are behind
them.&nbsp; The shot follows the butterflies over a nearby village in the
valley below. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>Three native teenager girls are carrying round, earthen pots near
their bellies, smiling and laughing.&nbsp; As the young women walk through the
village, butterflies are landing on buildings, plants and a tour bus.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>We see a close-up of a butterfly landing on a flower at the edge
of the forest.&nbsp; A puff of yellow pollen is shaken from the pistol and
fills the air around it.&nbsp; The camera’s focal point shifts to the child
behind the flower.&nbsp; She’s watching the butterfly intently. The hand of the
father rests on the pregnant woman’s hand as they watch their child from up the
trail.&nbsp; The camera narrows in on the couple’s hands.&nbsp; She moves their
entwined fingers over the curve of her pregnant belly.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>The camera cuts to the hand of one of the three girls in the
village, which wraps around the pot she carries like one would hold a pregnant
belly.&nbsp; Each pot is painted with bands of light and dark that resemble the
planet Saturn.&nbsp; Each is perfectly spherical with a hexagonal opening.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>As the three women reach the center of their small village the sun
is setting.&nbsp; Each tosses the pot they are carrying forward into a circular
courtyard at the center of the village.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>The three pots impact each other from the sides, starting a
circular motion.&nbsp; The pieces shatter, mix and collide.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>The camera moves upward, turning slowly above the courtyard as the
pieces tumble across the ground in slow motion.&nbsp; From the central point of
impact they form a ripple of motion, bouncing upward and then spreading outward
in smaller, bouncing ripples.&nbsp; They move to the raised edge of the
courtyard’s circle, rebound and form a slight ripple back inward from the edge.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&#8220;Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour, step right this
way.&#8221;&nbsp; The camera widens outward from the circle in the village, clouds,
sunset and mountains.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";

as hundreds of butterflies alight on the flowers.&nbsp; The pregnant woman
smiles.&nbsp; The camera follows the butterflies through the trees as the last
rays of sun begin to filter through.</span></p>

'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>Here’s the theorem that forms the basis for the movie’s arch:</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>1. Hurricanes are calm in the center - due to rotational gravity.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>2. Black holes also have a calm eye - since 99% of the matter
circulates - as reported last month.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>3. Similarly, the core of the earth is probably less dense iron
than the surround iron due to the outward pull of gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp; A less dense
core with alternating layers of density would contain pressurized water, which
accounts for the flooding on Mars and Noah’s flood.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>4. The inter-locking shape of the continents suggests that the
Earth may expand and contract, with internal density changing to adjust for
wobble, external orbital influences from other planets and meteor impacts.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>5. All of these systems (hurricanes, planets, solar systems,
galaxies) are defined by their edge gravity, rather than their center.&nbsp;
Heated air carries rain upward in the wall of the hurricane falling down as
rain on the arms.&nbsp; Matter heats as it approaches the center of the galaxy,
changes state as it is ejected into less dense space and returns to form new
stars in the spiral arm.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>6. The sun itself could be largely hollow, pulled outward by its
own mass and the surrounding planets.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>7. We uses similar accelerating spherical processes to create
dreams.&nbsp; During dream sleep and daydreaming, energy circulates the outer
edges of the brain’s folds, pulling &#8220;focus&#8221; away from the center.&nbsp; This
motion defines moods and emotions in the subconscious outer parts of our
brains, which then rain down later during consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>This year, we’ll start to receive data from the Hadron Collider which
may reveal that the universe itself is defined by an outer boundary, and that
our 3D perception of reality is defined by the extension of 2D light into the
area we inhabit.&nbsp; At least that’s what the guy in charge of the smaller
collider in Illinois says.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";
'>For one of our dramatic endings, the parents will fly a spaceship
into or around the sun.&nbsp; Their spaceship will use a &#8220;hot plasma&#8221; container
for a fusion engine with retractable sales.&nbsp; For some the sun will
represent lost love and for others their parents.&nbsp; Viewers may choose to
combine all the endings as one.&nbsp; In which case, flying into the sun is the
most direct route into deep space.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";

<p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri","sans-serif";

narrator may have a brain tumor.&nbsp; He brings together other crackpot
theorists to explore each of the ideas above, and bounce them off their
children.&nbsp; We are never quite sure if he and his crew are madman or truly
brilliant.</span></p>

<p>The Red Sea parts and we hear voices,</p>

<p>The Red Sea whirls and we make realizations.</p>

<p>This morning’s k&#333;an was the process of the k&#333;an
itself.&nbsp; I went to bed thinking about the analogy between the Red Sea
parting and the separation of the left and right brain in thinking.&nbsp; My
speculation is that religious law-and-order experiences occur when the left and
right brain are the least connected directly, when they instead communicate to
each other as two distinct entities.&nbsp; The experience of Moses receiving
the commandments is one of both hemispheres being very active, but with minimal
cycling between the two lobes – allowing the creative side to talk to the
analytical side.</p>

<p>As I lay there this morning, I encouraged the energy in my
head to rotate rapidly throughout my cranium.&nbsp; In a few seconds I have the
realization that the act of rapid rotation during a relaxed sleep is what
occurs when insights come early in the morning.&nbsp; My brain quickly shifts
back into &#8220;left brain – right brain&#8221; mode to capture the insight.&nbsp; This is
why we have only one major insight per morning, and then jump up to act on
it.&nbsp; Continued cycling would not allow the creative thought to be captured
and analyzed.&nbsp; Writing the thought brings added clarity since the
analytical mind can fully digest the creative.</p>

<p>Full brain cycling is the exact opposite of focusing.&nbsp;
It probably occurs during deep sleep.&nbsp; I’ve still not fully recovered from
the dense focal spot that was in my head last week.&nbsp; The ambient music
spread out the focal point with its long waves.&nbsp; But then my entire brain
felt a little mushy.&nbsp; More angular music helped.&nbsp; The focal spot is
still there though, within the right lobe near the center, two inches back from
the eye.&nbsp; So last night I massaged it briefly by mentally cycling energy
through it.&nbsp; Felt good, I’d been avoiding doing that thinking it could
aggravate it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was thinking, &#8220;gosh, was it several days of a
dense focal point part of the inspiration for several mornings of
writing?&#8221;&nbsp; Are the days after inebriation or sleep deprivation or cell
phone usage the times when artists are the most productive?</p>

<p>Each chapter will visually represent a brain function and
the related waves.&nbsp; The first chapter is a crack in the skull as the Mayan
pottery scatters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sudden awakening.&nbsp; In ancient cultures,
holes were drilled in the head of living individuals to reduce pressure.&nbsp;
When Abbey walked into a pole yesterday, I told myself it hurts now, but a
thump to the head may help form the cracks that allow for the expansion in grey
matter.</p>

<p>My high school humanity teacher said he woke up one morning
and his entire brow had expanded forward.&nbsp; Now that’s a major tectonic
shift.&nbsp; He looked more like an ape man from that day forward.</p>

<p>I read that the Jewish tribes taught their warriors to fight
left-handed to catch their enemy off guard.&nbsp; The other counties of the
middle east suppress left-handedness, since it is taboo to use the left hand
for any activity except the wiping of the derrière.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My mother is shopping at the international market with her
black babushka on to keep her head warm.&nbsp; The workers are staring at
her.&nbsp; The clerk at the meat counter asks her if she is Muslim.&nbsp; I
suspect they were watching her reach for items with her left hand.</p>

<p>This stance would have lead left handed people to be cast
out, to contribute more genetic material to the wandering tribes of the
Jewish.&nbsp; Could these right brained people been more likely to become
scribes and artists?&nbsp; Surely.</p>

<p>I was thinking about religious thinking after yesterday’s
scout meeting.&nbsp; I’m surrounded by a group of more God following and
fearing individuals than my average preschool parents cluster.&nbsp; I think to
myself, is the difference between the political spectrum that right-wing
individuals use their lobes more independently?&nbsp; Red Sea parted.&nbsp; Do
they actually live in a universe of more duality?&nbsp; This would explain why
they have more affairs.&nbsp; They build up a strong moral code side, but the
emotional, lustful size is less restrained by the logical side.&nbsp; Brains
divided.</p>

<p>I love hearing them talk about the marshmallow guns and how
they can’t fathom why someone would withdraw from scouts because of
these.&nbsp; I think about taking the head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference to a vegetarian restaurant two years ago and being surprised by his
lack of compassion for the life style.&nbsp; I think about the secret affairs
that are more predominant in church culture.&nbsp; At tonight’s den leader
meeting, the scout master is absent again.&nbsp; He’s a traveling phone
salesman and I wonder if his wife, who is present, thinks about why he could
not make the meeting at the last minute?</p>

<p>It’s not that religious individuals use less of their brain,
it’s that the two hemispheres function more independently.&nbsp; Is this
duality genetic, or shaped within the womb?&nbsp; I’m less inclined to think brain
function is cultural or social than I used to be.&nbsp; Watching children, we
see that they are born with a personality that they carry through their
lives.&nbsp; Religion is not a personality type, but conviction is. &nbsp;Nuns
have a lot of conviction.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Dali Lama is selected by observing children and their
level of compassion.&nbsp; Will the search to find the next Dali Lama deploy
the use of brain wave MRI scanners to narrow the field to children with
patterns similar to the most recent Lama?</p>

<p>The title of this chapter is a funny one, because it brings
to mind bicycling.&nbsp; The best way to reshape the patterns of the brain is
through humor.&nbsp; Laughter is the process of creating disruptive waves which
shake and redistribute accepted notions.&nbsp; Children laugh when they see
anything unusual.&nbsp; They are re-compartmentalizing - shifting their world
view ever so slightly with each rhythmic wave of laughter.</p>

<p>The issues presented here are weighty ones, since they look
directly at the left-right nature of the middle east and the political
separation that exists in all cultures.&nbsp; So we need a light hearted theme,
Einstein on a bicycle.&nbsp; Full brain cycling…</p>

<p>I’m taking this picture with me when I go to get my next
haircut!</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to see Einstein take a fall, to unleash
the limitations his thought imposes on our ability to travel faster than
light.&nbsp; And to better observe the dense matter that surrounds us, the high
and low pressure differences that occur throughout the universe that cause
vortexes and waves to form, rise in the center and fall back upon themselves,
like thought processes.&nbsp; And to teach my children this awareness as they
toss a stick in the pond.&nbsp; I lay back on the grass staring at the sky,
drifting away - until a kind woman, the duck-kimosabi, jolts me back. &#8220;Is it
okay if I ask your children not to throw things at the ducks?&#8221;&nbsp; Wack, a
hit to the side of the head.</p>

LIGHTNING STRIKES

2/11/2010

Sent to Dad and Marcia - This morning's exerpt


I’m not your ordinary crackpot.  I’m a brilliantly cracked pot, whose shards and colors impact the world and power the sun.

 

I went to bed last night with the question, who will be the next parent character we introduce as we follow the butterfly migration north from Mexico?  The answer arrived within the first minute of waking.  And here’s the bizarre thing, the brilliance of the answer was so powerful that I could literally feel the subconscious brain snappling and crackeling as it started to put together the implications and scenarios long before I even started to think about them.

 

The answer was Tiger Woods, oh the glory of it.  The powerful emotional response of a million loving and hating fans is enough to power the entire universe.  Tiger is at his ranch in Texas.  The beloved Tiger woods, held so high by father-in-law Jimmy, who fell so low in an instance.  Jimmy can’t figure out why Golf (with a capital “G”) has not immediately banned Tiger.  I tell him that Pete Rose cheated on the game of baseball.  Tiger’s sins have not impacted the playing of the game, but for my father-in-law they have, profoundly.  Still, I suspect and hope that Tiger will climb back, as he always has.

 

Here’s what’s profound, the energy I felt in my brain was not cycling, it was synapses firing,  everywhere.  But I wasn’t consciously thinking thoughts.  I was just relishing the happy emotion of such an earth shattering selection.  If there was any hope to the theory that our brains transform energy on a quantum level, then I was converting a boat load.  I was powering the sun.  I suspect that my subconscious mind was drawing together many connections, ones that I would start to interact with shortly.  These rolling short waves almost make the body want to shake or tremble.  Mental laughter is occurring, tiny seismic jingling.

 

Okay, here’s the great irony, the comedy and tragedy rolled into one.  Tiger is our greatest cultural hero and our greatest/worse adulterer.  He has taken on God status at the level of Zeus or Jupiter, the lecherous Gods with women in every port.

 

Tiger is essential to the story line because he will chart the course for our trip around the sun, like an expert golf swing.   Tiger’s keen eye can point a spacecraft at the right trajectory to skate the edge of the sun.  Without burning up and without being flung off.  Tiger will find the sweet spot, an orbit that will allow us to reach the speed of light within the photon sphere of the sun, and safely step over to the other side.

 

The introduction of Tiger shifts the entire story line.  Now we are no longer waiting for the parents to grow old before they travel off to the sun.  With Tiger on board, I am now charting a course to skate the sun without delay.

 

The character representing Tiger, hopefully tiger himself, will be one of the high paying guests at the family vacation retreat.  He’ll likely attend with his wife.  This will be super effective at building the conflict between all the parents, while the kids play.

 

The plot progression will therefore need to lead to the near-term death of one of the parents.  This will occur after the Mayan New Year celebration and before the parents take a flight on the new Virgin Galactic orbital rocket.

 

Here’s the fun part, our brilliant minded scientists have somehow figured out a way to accelerate the Virgin Galactic orbiter beyond the pull of gravity.  They set sail for the sun to rescue their lost friend.  It’s exactly the wacky sort of pirate move I’ve been after!  Virgin Gorda is in the chain of islands that form the setting for Treasure Island, so a modern day pirate theme winds its way through the group’s escapades.

 

And here’s another exciting part.  I know which parent will have died, it’s Brandon Barber, the student council president at my high school.  Brandon’s got the right Houdini energy to escape death, or in the very least to inspire a group of rag-tag misfits to go to the edges of the universe to find him.  He’ll have those big army boots on, so he can survive anything.  Brandon marched in to save Weni once when a large bully was making advances on her and she called me from her house to ask if I could help get him to leave.  Maybe Weni has died?  Yes, that’s more emotional.  Brandon is leading the charge to rescue her.  But why not me?  I feel the sinking.  Why not me.  I need to be there too.  Wow, I could really feel that drop in emotions.  When Weni called me many years ago, I sent in Brandon – a neighbor of hers about seven condos away.  Would my parents (mom and stepdad) have let me borrow the car if I’d asked?  This question will take more time to resolve.  It strikes me now that this turning away was the instance that set up the self loathing I felt for putting schoolwork first.  I wanted to be the rescuer, this was the knight in shining armor roll that I so wanted to build into the relationship.  To ride up on a white horse, instead I allocated.  This time I need to be by Brandon’s side during the rescue.

 

What if when the group disappears from our reality, they still continue to communicate with friends using Facebook?  That would be funny in the dreams of one of the characters who have remained behind.  Like a phone call from the dead in times of yore.  The lost Weni should communicate from Facebook into dreams.  That could motivate the group to take on such an insane venture.

 

Weni was there when the sounds of Saturn were first heard by human ears.  Has this experience provided her with the ability to communicate from beyond?  Or are the mushrooms of our mushroom scientist having an effect on the group?  Or both? 

 

Richard Branson has been subtly pitching $200,000 rides on his new spacecraft to members of the gathering.  The group members are now very interested.

 

When I watched the Life Aquatic last week, I was disappointed.  It was all about death at sea.  Now I seem to have made it relate.  The ocean is such a direct path into our subconscious.  The rhythm of the waves is sadness and deep sleep.  We can capture this much better than the Life Aquatic by placing the grief scene at the ocean late at night.  The group sits on a beach on a starry night after the loss.  They are stretched to the ends of their emotions.  After a night of arguing, they have been hit with a loss.  How do they cope?

 

When I went to the Baja Peninsula during spring break in college my sophomore year, one of the girl’s parents was shot and killed at a gas station back in Los Angeles.  Part of our group returned with her.  I stayed and sung a lot on the beach, it was very sad.  Part of the sadness was because I felt abandoned by my friends.  Selfish.  I felt left behind with a group I didn’t feel totally connected with.  Another group camped near us.  We belted out Violent Femme songs like there was no tomorrow.  I’m departing from the script here, but it sets the groundwork for a later time when my friends Richard, Donna and I sat on the cliffs in Isla Vista overlooking the sea and singing Beetle songs.  Loss and the sea go hand in hand.

 

Our group sings, they unite.  They find a common ground in the sadness.

 

They return back to their regular lives, but each has a revelation in a waking dream which inspires them to set aside reason and pursue the crazy idea of a rescue.  One communicates with Weni on Facebook in a dream.

 

I’ve often heard conflicting stories that lightening originates from the sky or is ground up.  This morning’s daily Code Project newsletter has a link to high speed photography that solves the riddle…

 

http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/02/gallery-lightning/

 

The photographer writes…

 

The video shows a downward-propagating negatively charged, stepped leader. The lightning branches out in many different directions, causing one leader to make a connection with the ground, creating a bright return stroke.

 

The lightning was filmed at 7,200 images per second (139 microseconds per image). The downward leaders are traveling at a couple of hundred kilometers per second. The bright return stroke travels upward at around half the speed of light, and is too fast to capture in more than one image.

 

Ah, now I know how Weni dies in the story.  A lightening strike while on the top of the boulders at Virgin Gorda.

 

My uncle George had a kinship with lightning.  His hair would rise up.  He was a legend in his own time.  A book unto himself and sorely missed.

My Family is Incredible

 

Our friend Narin and I are putting together family yoga classes.

 

The theme of the opening chapter (first class) is that mother nature is incredible.  It circulates around butterflies, pregnancy and children.

 

The theme of the second one will be exploring “incredible” roles for men in a world where women are increasingly the heroes.

 

The message throughout the classes will be how mental perception resonates. 

This resonance is represented by colliding pottery tiles in motion forming the Flower of Life in the center of our village.

Three primary colors will intertwine, yellow, amber and ocean blue, mixing to form other patterns in motion.

 

http://www.guide-to-symbols.com/fol/

 

Men as Builders, Men as Travelers and Men as Providers are the roles to explore in the next chapter.

 

To convey this, we’ll need a super-human feat from the husband.

 

In the opening chapter, the main female character, Jenni, is pregnant.  In chapter two her labor begins in the Mexican village on the morning a hurricane is arriving.  After being awaken by a raving call from an old boyfriend babbling something about Saturn blossoming, the sound of wind and rain is shattered by the sound of a race car coming through the slick village streets.  

 

Outside we see that people are beginning to emerge under the awnings of the village to view the race.  Many are dressed in customs, with skeletons painted on happy faces.  It’s the Pan-American vintage road race, culminating during the Day of the Dead celebration each year.

 

As the couple and their daughter pack and prepare to leave, each race car comes with increasing frequency, paralleling the increasing closeness of the contractions.

 

The families board the tour bus and begin to make their way down to the mountain toward a larger city where a modern hospital resides.  More Day of the Dead revelers are starting to take to the streets.

 

As the rain worsens, and the bus winds down the mountain, part of the road has collapsed ahead.

 

The men on the bus swings into action, building a makeshift bridge from corrugated roofing and timber.  Two race cars spin by and go over the bridge.  The bus is stuck in the mud.

 

The husband flags down the next racers, two men in a white vintage sports car.   There’s barely enough room from the woman to lay down it the back.  The navigator gives the passenger seat to the husband.  A grandmother character rests her hands on the shoulders of the couple’s young daughter, who stays at the bus. 

 

Together the three are off to get the woman to a hospital as the hurricane hits shore.  The driver skillfully navigates around cows crossing the road, falling trees, and other crashed racing cars.

 

But they can’t make it in time, the contractions are too close together.  The husband pounds on a thick door to get into a house.  A gruff man says in Spanish that there is no room.  They run into a stable to get out of the rain.

 

As the children (twins!) are delivered, the eye of the hurricane enfolds them in calmness.  The sun shines through the circling clouds.

 

The camera follows up the massive eye walls of the storm high into the atmosphere.

 

Chapter 3 – 3 months later

 

Cut to images of the massive eye wall at the north pole of Saturn.  Jenni has returned to work and she and her office mates are looking over detail images of layered walls where jet streams take sharp turns in the shape of a hexagon.  Dozens of hurricanes follow around each turn.  The group at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena is looking at newly created video assembled from images taken by the Cassini space probe.

Loren,

Gary Faules says: "how did he know we raced during The Day Of The Dead and
so on? Great stuff."

Gary wrote about the Day Of The Dead celebrants and had pictures on his
website.  I'm looking forward to tracking the photos down.  I'll add some
links to his site from the interactive slides laying out the story concepts.

It's always been one of my dreams to get you and the kids down there at the
same time as the race and the butterfly over-wintering.  In grad school,
Terri studied Spanish at one of the villages our friend Kim Bailey takes the
butterfly tour groups through now.

We had a solid five of sledding here tonight with 4 inches of snow.  The
steepest hill in Grant Park is on the side of the old civil war
embattlement.  We have the best sleds, so we always let passers-by take a
few turns.  It's fun to see how many old folk are willing to take the plunge
down these steep hills.  The snow is so rare here that many folks grab
whatever they have, we saw card board boxes, trash can lids and cookie
baking pans on the slopes.

Your son mentioned "I'll add some links to his site from the  interactive 
slides laying out the story concepts." I'm curious what that  means... Is he 
writing a story on a blog or something? I'm interested  in seeing it.

-Gary


Hi Gary, I'm writing a script and website for a "Mystery Tour" that will occur in the Virgin Islands during the Mayan New Year in Dec 2012.  I'll send you a link in a few months to review.  I may have some of the intro material posted online sooner.

I'm pitching the concept to a friend of mine who is a movie producer and former sound guy for the Beach Boys.

-Loren

Hello Loren,

 

LOL... Hey that's very cool! Please keep me posted I would love to see it progress.

 

Gary,


It’s become quite an “edge of your seat” adventure.

The pregnant woman in the chapter you read is based on a friend of mine. 

She’s a former Mrs. California who manages the Cassini deep space project at JPL in Pasadena.

There’s lots of interesting science content in the site designed for kids.

The “Mystery Tour” event will be for families and the main lesson of the movie is about adults learning from their children.

Should be a fun ride.


Gary replied:

Have you ever read The Pearl by Steinbeck?


Loren replied:

Great book!  I was Steinbeck for Halloween one year in Santa Barbara. 

Dust bowl attire.  Handed out grapes instead of candy.

Austen and I are planning to read Treasure Island next month.  He’s almost 8.

Have you been to “The Bathes” at Virgin Gorda?   That’s where the next portion of the story occurs.

Here’s a post of Gary’s from 2007.  The Road Ranger he posted about was also on  “Real People.” 

Wish the footage from those old shows was online.

What am amazing feat and one that humbles me. I am interested why someone  from Paw Paw would chose such a trip but assume because he has read about all  the beauty and admired "real" mountains instead of the "hills" found back east.  I doubt the part about the bears but if he is considering witting a book it  makes for good reading/book sales.

 

When I made the Olympic team and because of the fact that I was once blind  I was a guest on a popular 70's TV show called, "Real People". While I was there  I met another guest by the name of "Wrong Way Woulton" (spell??) He was famous  for riding his bike across the United States except he had done it backwards and  he did it using his mirrors!!! LOL. He had all his gear on his bike for the  journey. When I was talking to him I asked what else he had planned and he said  as soon as the show was over he was beginning another ride except this time he  would do it backwards around the border of the United States. Then one day I had  about 6 of my employees with me in a station wagon and I had never told them  about this guy and the show hadn't aired yet and as we were driving down a main  drag THERE WAS WRONG WAY!!! with some news media vans following and filming him.  LOL. After my guys got al;l excited seeing a guy ride his bike backwards I told  my guys I knew that guy and they all laughed and said "Oh sure you do!" so I  pulled up next to him and yelled his name. He stopped, looked in the car and  said, "GARY!" We talked a few moments and I had a good laugh with my guys.
