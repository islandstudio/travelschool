<p><a name="_MailAutoSig">Place this paragraph where Izzy's
lab is introduced:</a></p>


<p>It's actually easy to explain.  We attach our little donut here to one end of the 
	Large Haldran excellerator, pump it full of electrons traveling at the speed of light and create a spinning torus that acts as a singularity, capturing all incoming data fromt he surrounding environment, including sound and audio.</p>

<p>The difficulty comes in accessing that data without disrupting the balanced state of the internal electron spin.  We've been able to extract sound and image by repeatng frequencies of sound and light that occur at the time the data was recorded, but thus far we have no means to navigate data interactively.  Nor do we have a means to edit or alter the data once it's stored.</p>

<p>That's where our students come - our Dream Team.  In 2011 we started a series of experiments where we use magnets to sync the minds of our students and we use brain imagery to provide a feedback loop, so they can essentially "think" their way through the preserves data layers as if they were actually in the original location.</p>

<p>"Looks like this guy dozed off." I joke with Izzy as we round the EM macheing.</p>

<p>"Oh, The programmers have to fall asleep in the scanner, before starting they reach REM sleep and enter a stable lucid dream state,"" says Izzy.</p>

<p>That's a pretty good gig, sleeping on the job.</p>

<p>We use a series of light flashes to signal to them that they are in a lucid dream so they can consciously guide and manipulate the data.  We've created a  version of the storage device to hold which allows them to have a frame of reference.</p>

<p>How wide does the device record?</p>

<p>Theoretically there should be a very wide range, up to 3,000 miles.</p>

<p>Wow, that's a lot of data!</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, after a few miles the focus and clarity diminishes due to refraction caused be the gravitational force between electrons.</p>

 <p>If we've calibrated it correctly, it will record all the electro magnetic waves passing through it.  It's not all visible light, but a wide range of other energy, x-rays and gamma rays are being recorded to recreate a 3D image.  Currently we're training our developers to convert and use the full spectrum of data captured.</p>

<p>About one of his student assistants, who comes to work to
fall asleep: "I'm even careful how much milk I drink. I switched to oatmeal
and honey since a big bowl of cereal in the morning sends me back into
dreamland. If I want to get really trippy, I sleep without earplugs - the loud
air conditioner interrupts my deep-sleep. To compensate I end up toggling into
great daydreams throughout the day. Great if I were a writer, but not so great
when I'm a programmer."</p>

<p>Will is the drive to reduce dissonance between each of our active neural circuits.</p>

<p>All the different parts of the brain become active and inactive and interact without a core. A network of independent processors. Left hemisphere denies ideas that are not attached to our current paradigm. - Athena's Theory of Everything</p>

cores…</p>

<p>Idiot, you don't just have a mental map of the freakin' room in your mind, you have a mental map of the entire freakin' universe, to the extent that you've explored it.  Every synapse in your body is charting and expanding the details of that universe.  If you haven't seen it yet, it don't exist yet... in YOUR universe.  That doesn't mean it don't freakin' exist in mine.  Now shut-up and go get me another beer.</p>

<p>David sat down his guitar for a moment, &quot;If you know a song well, you know exactly what is coming next,</p>

<p>David responded, well sort of.&nbsp;
No recollection is perfect because, it relies on the approximations of the
past.</p>



<p>You know what is coming next only based on the patterns
of the past, patterns that seemingly repeat in grand ways.</p>



<p>A reaction to the past will pull you into where the future
will be.&nbsp; When you hear something that is a departure from the past, you
know you are projecting forward into the future.&nbsp; </p>





<p>Our brain is a lens, and it affixes us to one reference
point in time.&nbsp; Time itself is instantly transversible, but all coherent
meaning is replaced with emotions in the transit.&nbsp; Only bands of emotion can
traverse time.&nbsp; It's sad and humbling because we are the outlet of
expression.&quot;</p>

<p>Dreams - Backwards to go forward</p>



<p>You sit here and create a story going backwards, to explain
the ending.</p>



<p>The conclusion comes first, then you weave the path to get
to the </p>



<p>Consciousness experiences the path, as if free will were a
foot.</p>



<p>The challenge is figuring out the ending toward which paths
combine.&nbsp; And maybe the only outcome is repetition.</p>

<p>Much later...</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a plecebo, you're fucking killin' me!&quot;</p>


<p>&quot;Don't you get it... it doesn't matter if it did nothing.  You only had to BELIEVE it did!  Then your brain could do the rest.  The brain can take you anywhere.  Anywhere you can imagine.&quot;</p>
