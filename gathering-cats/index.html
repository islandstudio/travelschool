<h1>Gathering Cats</h1><!-- Acts of Nature -->

<p>Michael pressed the pay-phone to his ear and crouched close to the wall on the side of a old gas station a few miles from the Lebanese border.  His two children were curled up comfortably in bed a thousand miles away, listening intently to his every word. He picked up on the story he had been weaving when they were last together.</p>

<p>"Perched high on a limb overlooking the forest, Moki
  had arrived early before sunrise, to watch the other children coming up from
  the village below.  As they ascended the path, each was collecting the hollow gold and green chrysalises of the monarch butterflies that had emerged in the morning light.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was one girl in particular who stood out to Moki. Her name was Coda, and she was the most beautiful of the butterfly girls, at least to Moki. Her
smile, when it came, was tender and true."</p>

<p>And so began their favorite story, set in the hills of Central America over 11,000 years ago, two tribes, the Jaguar People of the forest and the Bird People from the north, who came together each spring to celebrate the departure of the monarchs.</p>

<blockquote class="pullquote hideMobile" style="float:right; margin-left:20px"><!--She entranced him. Her sun soaked shoulders were covered with freckles. Her
smile, when it came, was tender and true. -->Some mornings, she took care of her two
younger brothers, running after them as they darted through the forest and climbed over mossy rocks by the streams.</blockquote>

<p><span style="white-space:nowrap">"Coda was the</span> daughter of the Jaguar tribe leader whose family had moved to the hills after their land was taken. Each morning at the end of winter, Moki would silently watch her fill her basket with the shimmering chrysalises picked from the morning dew.&quot;</p>

<p>Their father's voice trailed off, distracted by the sound of mortar fire from the distant hills. He glanced over the top of his glasses, barely making out the line between the crests and the dark night sky.</p>

<p>"Dad, tell us more about Moki and Coda. Pleeeease."</p>

<p>"Okay, I have a little time before my ride arrives," Michael replied. The truck stop was mostly desolate here five miles outside an Israeli town, several miles southwest of the border. A dim light caught the smile on his face from across the desert as insects sounded a breathing rhythm from out of the night.</p>

<p>Their dad loved to tell stories that pulled together elements from his travels. He wove in aspects from his own father's research during the years they spent at digs in the jungle when he was young. Tonight, as his two children cuddled around the phone, Michael closed his eyes and fell effortlessly back into the long-ago world of Moki and Coda.</p>

<p>&quot;Coda's people lived amid the big cats year round, but Moki's people followed the migrations of the birds and butterflies to the north. They only passed through the forests for a few short weeks before reversing and following the migrations back to their homelands.&quot;</p>

<p>"From here, the butterflies would start a thousand mile migration that spanned several butterfly generations. Some would reach as far north as Quebec, and on rare occasion others would get blown all the way across the Atlantic to the British Isles.</p>

<p>"Moki's tribe charted their routes by following the birds across the plains and valleys, then returned each winter to the forests of the south, which they shared for several weeks with the Jaguar people based on a truce that had spanned hundreds of years.</p>

<div class="pullquote rightquote"><blockquote>As a child Moki would cover himself in feathers to win the
affection of the girl he loved.</blockquote></div>

<p><span style="white-space:nowrap">"On mornings like this,</span> Moki would <!--adorn himself with feathers and -->sit high atop the branches of the gently swaying trees gracefully extending his wings."</p>

<p>&quot;Can he fly?&quot; his daughter asked.</p>




<p>&quot;No, the feathers are just for show. His wings are covered with colors his tribe collected during their travels. Long feathers and short ones, white from the shore birds, blues and greens from the forests. As the bird tribe traveled, they also collected bright pigments to paint their faces - orange from clay, red from roots, yellow from mustard flowers and black from ashes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In his face paints, Moki would mix the iridescence gold from the chrysalises in a tiny copper bowl. It created a metallic luster, like you see from the refraction of light on oil. So it's not really a paint pigment, but more of a <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_gold_beads_on_a_monarch_butterfly_chrysalis#ixzz1wGemwWWq" target="pigment">structural iridescence.</a>&quot;</p>


<div style="clear:both"></div>

<blockquote class="pullquote rightquoteX">
She entranced him. Her sun soaked shoulders were covered with freckles.  
<span style="white-space:nowrap">Her eyes</span> reflected the shimmering gold of the chrysalises in her basket.
</blockquote>


<p>&quot;The light played off Coda's back as she moved through the forest below, bouncing off the dark wooden beads of her necklace as they slid across her neck while she searched among the leaves. She moved near Moki now, giving him a knowing smile as she watched him watching her.&quot;</p>

<p>A loud semi-truck rattled by, carrying heavy munitions and military hardware.</p>

<p>"Honey, the kids have fallen asleep, but I'm enjoying listening.&quot; his wife said while tucking them under the covers. She'd had a long day too, organizing details for their upcoming sendoff.</p>

<p>&quot;Only three days now.&quot; she continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Feels like we need ten more to pull everything together.&quot; Michael replied.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the sound of a smaller truck rumbled in from the night, its light reflecting off the metal edge of the phone and into his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Gotta go, they're here.&quot; Michael said as he stood up, shielding his eyes with his hand. The headlights illuminated the side of a war-torn gas station. The pickup truck made a wide arc, coming toward the side where Michael stood. Michael would soon be heading across the border on a route that would 
hopefully lead him to one the world's foremost mathematicians, Oseph Easthay. A man who knew a great deal about routes and outcomes.</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful over there." his wife said.</p>

<p>&quot;Will do,&quot; Michael bid farewell and put his glasses in his pocket. The wheels of the truck on the gravel parking lot had silenced the insects. Rubbing his head, he stared toward the light, then smiled as he saw Jill Avervance leaning out the window waving him over, looking mostly unchanged from their college days.</p>

<p>Jill jumped from the truck and pulled down the seat so Michael could push in his bag. Her hair moving across her back reminded him of Coda in his mind's eye.</p>

<p>Jill started to squeeze into the small back behind the seat, making way for Michael in the passenger seat as she introduced him to Hudson Greenich, a Russian-American woman whom Michael felt an immediate connection to.  Hudson would be their driver, having lived in Lebanon half a dozen years, she knew the area well where they'd be tracking down Oseph.</p>

<p>"I'll take the back, I'm dog tired," Michael said as tucked his head in before Jill could say no. It was a cozy spot and soon he felt very relaxed despite being miles from home with miles to go.

<p>As Hudson navigated the curving dirt roads, the truck climbed higher and higher into the hills. Jill and Hudson had become close friends during their years working together in the Middle East after college.  Both had since moved back to the states and only occasionally returned to the Middle East for work assignments.  Jill was a journalist and Hudson had applied training as a biochemist to a wide range of careers, including her most recent gig as an investigator for Delta airlines. She seemed to be always moving on to something new.</p>

<p>At the crest of the hill Hudson pulled off to the side and the two women put on vales to make traveling through the border check point smoother. The view was astounding, reminding Michael of so many starry nights in the hills back home. In an instance they had transformed themselves from westerns to cloaked locals. Jill said something softly in Arabic and the two laughed. The contrast of the vales and the rugged individualism tucked underneath made Michael smile.<!--Regardless of the circumstance, the two women were anything but conventional.--></p>

<p>Soon they were moving again and Michael found himself nodding off as they bumped along the uneven road, waking occasionally to hear the murmur of the women talking as Jill leaned forward over the seat<!--, her lips beside Hudson's ear-->.</p>

<p>Michael had yet to learn it, but Hudson Greenich was a force of nature. She'd drive though the night without hesitation or a sign of exhaustion. Whatever it took, nothing would stand in her way. Not a veil, not a border guard, not the ancient verses of Sharia that once forbid women to drive.</p>

<blockquote class="pullquote rightquote">Coda was now a princess in name only, for without their homeland they had only the butterfly hills, a gathering place they shared with the bird tribe based on a truce that had spanned hundreds of years.</blockquote>

<p><span style="white-space:nowrap">As Michael drifted off,</span> the story of the forest again echoed through his mind.  This time, Moki leaned over the water looking at his reflection, his legs, mostly useless, had confined him to the forests for much of his life. His tribe carried him northward each year until he became too heavy. Then he would remain with the Jaguar tribe, learning their customs and becoming one with them from age 7 onward. He was their Bird Jaguar, flightless yet free as he scaled the trees and moved effortlessly between their branches.</p>

<p>A dozen years had passed since Moki had joined his new tribe. During that time the Jaguar home land had been upended by the influx of an ocean-going tribe who had arrived in kayaks from the northeast after the diamond storms.</p>

<p>Coda's people had abandoned their villages on the shores of the rivers, and took to the hills year round. Yet even in their hardship, they continued to gather annually with their traveling bird tribe at the start of each spring.</p>

<p>"Moki had gone down to the water to apply the colors to his face for what might be the last time. Bending down, he looked at his reflection in the small stream that ran through the moss-covered tree roots.  Earthen paints of red, orange and brown mud from the silty stream bed. Lastly, he applied tiny flecks of gold from the chrysalis across his brow to complete his transformation into Bird Jaguar. To his right, the boat he had been building from the bark of the fig nut tree, and another 30 boats of his fellow Jaguar tribesman. Darkness was coming soon as the last rays of sun reflected off the highest trees, his home no more, for now he was off to war.</p>

<p>"To Coda's people, the rolling clouds above the monarch forest were the edge of the universe, where the sun's energy folded inward in a ritual of courtship with the dreaming land. There, across the sky, the storyteller and dreamer entwined and fell backwards from the sun, their arching path traced by two butterflies, locked together and swiftly tumbling earthward."</p>

<p>Michael felt the vehicle's motion in his dream as the truck bumped and tumbled along the road. Hudson navigated the uneven road along the border with expert skill as the steering wheel moved loosely between her hands. The checkpoint lights grew brighter on the horizon. Soon it would be Michael's turn to drive as they crossed the border, but for now he drifted back into memories of the past, only now the bumps were river rapids as they moved down river toward the sounds of the occupying tribe encamped out along the wide coastal flood plains below.</p>

<!--
<p>Hopefully tomorrow they'd know for sure if Oseph would be a good fit for the team. It was the final interview of a series Michael put into action only a short year ago, a process which was now moving forward at a near fever pace as pieces and people from around the world began to come together for the month ahead.</p>
