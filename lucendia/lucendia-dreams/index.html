<h1>Lucendia Dreams</h1>

<p>I was glad for Lucendia, she needed the sleep, desperately. But I felt more alone than I had in a long time. So far away now, and getting further by the moment.</p>

<p>These last few calls before our transmissions ended forever, would stay with me.</p>

<p>Lucendia whispers into the phone "In my dream, you and I were two strands of DNA, twirling and intertwined around eachother."</p>

<p>Now, the very act of thought is like time traveling into the past. When you get there your actions redefine the present.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Lancroft Institute</h3>

<p>You're here a little early, sit down and I'll be right back.</p>

<p>The Lancroft institute had developed a new storage device, with the capacity to store a seemingly infinite amount of information using a newly discovered form of circular magnitism.  The challenge now was, how deep does it go?</p>

<p>Programmable in a lucent state, a team of developers embarked on a mission to reach the inner valance layer, at the center of the memory stone.</p>

<p>&quot;What's it like, traveling there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not really a place you go, it's a place you think about.&quot;</p>

<p>What struck me the most was that I was completely unaware of gravity, that my mind could completely negate the effect of the surrounding earth's pull. I mean, I could hear the sounds around me as I laid there sleeping, and even make out light patterns from the mask. But there was absolutely no reference to gravity, and hence I had no spatial connection to my sleeping self.</p>

<p>As you near the valance layer, the challenge becomes separating information from it's source, there's a multitude of voices in the feedback. Where's the chorus from? It exists in our minds, subdued. In our surface consciousless, we're not aware of weighing input from multiple sources, multiple expereinces, internal intellects - all this boils down to a sense of morality from our higher level perspective. In the memorystone space, we're observing the  aggregating feedback where it gets boiled down to create a synphonic response, a sense of harmony or discord. A symphony of deep rooted opinion.</p>

<p>"I just want, to be, desired," she had said, then took a long drink of milk.</p>

<p>I smiled and pulled open an Oreo cookie.</p>

<p>The inner jacket reads:</p>

<p>"No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure some great pleasure."</p>


<p>I turn the page and continue reading:</P>

&nbsp; Aaron O'Connell - TED Live 2011<br>
</p>

<p>In 2011, Aaron O'Connell amazed the world with a simple experiment that used a single pulse of sound in a subzero, vacuum chamber to vibrate a tiny piece of metal - into two locations at the same time. Years of focused work had paid off. Dylan's dream of reproducing a macroscopic quantum action had been realized.  <a

<p>Dylan Millan had arrived on campus the day Aaron was making the paradigm changing discovery. Now, five years later, Dylan had steered the breakthrough research into a large-scale experiment of his own.</p>

<p>An eight foot bronze sculpture of The Thinker by Rodin sat in the courtyard 20 meters from the lab. Dylan wouldn't just vibrate a tiny piece of metal, he'd supersize. 

One of the original 28 castings created by Rodin himself in 1904 the statue was on loan to the university by one of the project's chief benefactors, Teresa Lancroft. The piece had graced her covered courtyard for years, a gift from her father, the renowned inventor professor Charles (Charlie) Lancroft.</p>

<!--
  <p>Dylan's experiment used a large cylendar suspended in a liquid nitrogen, magnetic spin chamber.  All air is removed fron the surrounding chamber.  The inner canister contains experiment monitoring equipment.  Incidentally, it's also large enough to hold a person.</p>
-->

<p>And in the end, I suppose the conquest was the key, and the lock closed, and the universe repeated, again. The push, the pull, but there is always a third way around which we gravitate. You almost forgot.  We walk through these parallel facets of existance, yours and mine.  There is another path. Somewhere, in between.</p>
