<h2>Moki Rises Early</h2>

  <p>Moki <!--, a distant descendant of Coda and Moki,--> lived in the trees on the edge of the forest in the Tennessee Valley where limestone caves dotted the hillsides.  From the age of three, when his tribe returned from their copper pilgramge, they adorned him with feathers. Oh how he wished someday he would join them in their run. But his oddly jointed knees would always lead the tribe to leave him behind.</p>

  <p>When not in the safety of the trees, Moki would asend to explore the caves where the forest floor met the limestone hills. Here, in the narrow crevasses, he was most adept, accustomed to pulling himself along, the strength of his arms grew and allowed him to grip with one hand while holding his light between his teeth and his drawing tool in the other.</p>

  <p>Over the years he would create magnificent murals far beneath the earth, following the flow of underwater rivers to hugh cavernous spaces. He loved illustrating the stories of the land to the north as it was described to him by the other members of the running tribe, where he so longed to travel. He imagined himself as a bird in flight, no longer limitated by his knees.</p>

<p>While he was young, Moki was cared for by Shinwa, an older woman from the Jaguar Tribe who brought him food and the tools he would use to paint pots with her on the shores of the river as he developed his art of soaring heights and endless rivers.
</p>

<h2>Coda's Tribe</h2>

<p>To understand Coda, you had to understand what made her tribe unique. They were living here in the valley separated from the larger tribes. Their secluded farms preserved a tranquil peace. There were no big migrations through the valley, only birds and butterflies came with the seasons. Their cave art was distinctly different from the other tribes. As a cave artist, Moki extended this tradition, adding a twist of his own.</p>

<h2>In the Forest</h2>

<p>
Austen called out from across the trails and bike jumps, "Dad, come check it out! They've built something new!"

We tumbled into the half-underground dugout.  The roof above a shelter from the rain.

Around the Jesus image, bottle caps were pressed in the partial arch of a circle.

There it was, the same blue Jesus I'd seen in the office dream.  Calm, reassuring, hilarious.

Later that day, the tinyest of bubbles had formed on my arm, from one tiny raindrop that had tumbled across the vines above.

<h2>Repeating Patterns</h2>
<p>
You have to look for a pattern that is repeating, across the most information sources. Thus far we haven't found anything, no clear artifacts for interpreting the system's latent memories.

<p>This search was so frustrating, the entire chapter contained only Latin gobbly gook, Lorem ipsum. I'm not going to tolerate this. I've got to call the publisher to complain, surely this can't be the case for every published copy.  Should I skip to the next chapter, what if I'm missing something important where the Lorem ipsum text is appearing?</p>

<p>I called my friend to see if she had made it this far.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I think it's an interesting thing to think about," she said.  "That this is a moral code, and that it's repeating over and over again throughout our information systems, unbeknownst to us. If an artificial intelligence were to analyse this in their effort to understand human nature, think of the implications. Morality is baked in... accidentally, by some early typesetter?"</p>

<p>Why are distant quasars in the same regions of the sky as clusters of closer galaxies? Are galaxies formed along the same charged paths as quasars?

Galaxies and quasars (massive blackholes from the early universe) spin on an axis that’s parallel to their filament. Many of the quasars rotation axes were aligned with each other — despite the fact that they were separated by billions of light-years.

Wondering about how people communicate with ancestors this Mayan holiday, my thought in reply "if you want to, you can." And with the thought, my eyes move quickly down to the left with a noticeably sudden jerk.  Ah, the side of the brain that speaks with it's own voice, reflecting back.  I'm intrinsically critical of post-Christians who profess a belief in ghosts, likewise I find it intriguing that ghosts are intertwined with an otherwise skeptical Judaism, though more so in dreams.  
-->

<P>Where is the collection of deep inner voices, do they percolate to the surface as only one dominant thought? Is the other lobe of the brain providing the counter-thought or observation? If there is a chorus at a deeper level, does it becomes one voice once it climbs its way to conscious thought? To hear the granularity of the chorus, one must detach from conscious thought.</P>

<P>Condense the key stories of your life down into compact tales, 
with key characters and the structural elements of fables.</P>

<h2>A dialog between two cave explorers</h2>

<!--
<p>The following dialog from <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/03/americas_ancient_cave_art.4.html">Slate</a> is between two spelunkers inspecting cave art dating around 1160 at the Woodland/Mississippian threshold on the Cumberland Plateau.</p>
-->

<p>Resting before the hike back to the truck, Jan said, &quot;Think about it. What was there none of in that cave?&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>I had no answer. Hadn't there been everything in that cave?</p>

<!-- Direct quote -->
<p>The previous guide, Simek, had said he suspected these particular caves were a holdover of some localized, regional woodland culture, from before it was either swept away or homogenized by the spread of the Death Cult.</p>

<p>&quot;Out of more than three hundred images, there wasn't a single weapon anywhere,&quot; Jan said. &quot;We have here an early Mississippian art in which there are no images of violence, where the birds are pure birds, not linked to war—they're in flight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even the human figures are not obviously warriors,&quot; I added.<br>
</p>
<p>Also there had been women and sex in that cave. I thought about it. No women and sex in any of the other caves.<br>
  </p>
<p>&quot;The old­-time religion,&quot; Jan said.</p>

<p>Did you know Native Americans arrived in the Americas with a genetic identity of 1/3 early European and 2/3 East Asian when the ice wall melted in Alaska? The same early European DNA remains unmixed today in the Italian island of Sardinian, the Basque Country of Spain and the Druze population in the Middle East (fifty percent of Druze populations live in Syria, thirty to forty percent in Lebanon, six to seven percent in Israel, and one or two percent in Jordan).</p>
