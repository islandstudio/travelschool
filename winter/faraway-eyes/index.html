<h1>Faraway Eyes</h1>
<p>Was that Helena? Arms down at her side. Walking alone on the side of the busy freeway, we sailed by so fast, it was hard to make a decision. The clocks ticking through our minds. The girl who had introduced us, yet neither of us could make an emotional commitment to investigate if that was who we'd seen. To this day, the experience was like seeing a spector, calling, the act of not helping.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to take this and give it to you. Put it in your pocket and don't ask questions.&quot; He handed me what looked like a large version of a wedding ring. What... oh just go with it, I learned to stop asking questions when he said to long ago.</p>
<p>There is a natural urge for each young lady to seek out her own cave once she occurs a man. But then what comes next? How does she deal with the complexities of daily life? Does she bring over her parents, do the couple find another single woman to come help, and how does the presense of a second woman in the house wear on the man's well being.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to find tranquility from the storm. Everyone will
  have their own path, their own story.&quot;</p>
