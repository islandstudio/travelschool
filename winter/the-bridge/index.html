<h1 class="mainTitle">The Bridge</h1>

<p>The wind is blowing strong tonight, spurning clouds from the northwest. And if you turn your head just right, the guide line pattering on the bridge above sounds like the mews of tiny kittens, waiting to be fed.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mother would take me high above the Illinois River and stand me firmly on the rail of the Ottowa Bridge, gripping me tightly, so I'd have no fear. Arms outstreatched, tonight we were saying goodbye to our river before heading south in the morning.</p>

I would swing on the bars, the monkey bars, and that was our river.

<p>The water rolled past, thick like slow flowing metal, transfixing my stare as the breeze moved around us from below the dark pylons and the last car passed behind us. And for an instance, the wind stopped and the hum of the wires drifted away into a silence that made me catch my breath and glance upward over my left shoulder. A silence that was somehow scarier than all the sound, the wind and movement of water and cars behind us.</p>

<p>I have an anger here, because I am also being let go of my attachment to feminity, to the ideal of oneness, of comfort, of synchronicity. I am now truely alone. Effectively dead?</p>

<p>The deep billow of a barge called in the distance, like a mother cat answering, &quot;I'll be home soon.&quot; It was in that calming call, I felt my heart beat pause and my legs began to buckle below me. With a hypnotic calm I could feel myself sagging toward the water. Thankfully her arms remained clasped around me, for in that moment I imagined I was falling, down, down, down, and the dark water rising up.</p>

<p>The certainty of things returned almost instantly, with an upward rush of wind returning, as if nothing had changed, except now I understood Fear - and I grasped her neck, cluthing her fingers so tightly they had turned a purple blue by the time we reached the car.</p>

<p>Thank god her arms remained tightly around me, because in that prolonged moment I imagined I was falling, down, down, and the dark water rising up to envelope me, I also felt something more, and it left me unsettled for year to come.</p>

<p>To really understand the full swing of events, we have to start back at that bridge in Ottowa, Illinois. We were saying our last goodbyes to the Midwest, our small UHaul packed for our new life in North Carolina.  Just me, a five year old boy at the time, and my mother, Vivian, heading into the great unknown.</p> 

<p>A smiling boy, I hang my head out of the window of our 1972 blue Pontiac, my hands extend into the wind. A tent camper trailer with a blue tarp is towed behind our car. It's not the car my dad drove to work. His was a '57 Chevy with the floor rusted through in places.</p>

<p>&quot;You're coming out, 1... 2... 3...&quot;</p>
          <p>And there she was, beautiful as always, the doctor who ran the lab, leaning over me, untying the bounds that held me to my chair.</p>
          <p>She reached over my head, and tenderly began to remove the fill wires from my hair. Fingers running 
          	through, meshing out the tiny filaments that recorded blood movement as I dreamed.</p>
          <p>"But what happens if I fall into the stream?" I asked like a child would softly asking his mother a question, my relaxed state still lulling my thoughts. "It seemed so inviting, so aware."</p>
          <p>&quot;That's a pure data steam. we're still not sure what happens if you drop in. One man may know, but he's not talking.&quot;</p>
          <p>The recluse shadow of an old man still young still haunted me, his old eyes peering out from young skin. Stoic and rocking often, a brilliant mind still, but void of emotion, always holding something back deep within.</p>
          <p>The ghost man they call him, he's not all there.</p>
          <p>---</p>
          <p>I turned toward the doctor, &quot;Are you sure this will work? I mean, if we're collapsing these layers down to synaptic responses, won't there be some muddying in the data, will we ever have precision?&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;Emotional machine thought is not based on precision, it's based on pattern recognition. Programming is no longer about bits and bytes, it's about manipulating sound and vision, vast quanitites of data that can only be summaried and understood at an emotional level. The excitement of a certain olfactory shade of red, the reflection of light off a rapidly expanding surface, these are things that can never be described fully with speech or code, they have to be experienced first hand.&quot;</p>
          
          <p>And the diamonds shall come from the sky.</p>


The hardest thing to learn in life is which bridge to cross.<br><br>

<p>
Dangling from a wire, my wife's voice a soft sound in the distance below. Why here, why now? Far below, my own children could be heard playing on the floor by my wife, tugging at something and talking in hused voices as others moved through the room.</p>


<p>Homer Wilkins was one of those great American hobby Physicists.  
Steeped in science, but still firm in the religious beliefs of the settlers.  In Homer's midst science took on a mystical quality, like peering into the eye of God.  Here in his tinkerer's lab, one could peer into time.  
From the ancient compasses of bygone sailers, to the flying machine prototypes of men who studied birds in motion.

<p>The child clutching tightly to his parent was inspired by the first time I took Austen to watch fireworks when he was 15 months old. &nbsp;The loud bangs, he clung to me like he'd never let go. I felt terrible, but I also felt terribly needed.  The next part on Antartica was initially writen for my daughter's class, inspired by walking blindfolded in the snow with my friend when we were 11 in Michigan.</p>
