<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553370901/ref=nosim/neardeathcom-20">Tibetan Book of the
Dead</a>, whose actual title is "<a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/bardo/tibetan.html">The Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Intermediate State</a>"
or "Bardo Thodol", is traditionally believed to be the work of the legendary Padma Sambhava in the 8th century A.D.
The book acts as a guide for the dead during the state that intervenes death and the next rebirth.
He is considered to be one of the first persons to bring Buddhism to Tibet.
The Bardo Thodol is a guide that is
read aloud to the dead while they are in the state between death and
reincarnation in order for them to recognize the nature of
their mind and attain liberation from the cycle of rebirth.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Bardo Thodol teaches that once
awareness is freed from the body, it creates its own reality as one would
experience in a dream. This dream occurs in various phases  (<a href="http://www.diamondway.org/bt/bt9tsechu.htm">bardos</a>)
in ways both wonderful and terrifying. Overwhelming peaceful and wrathful visions
and deities appear. Since the deceased's awareness is in confusion of no longer being
connected to a physical body, it needs help and guidance in order that enlightenment
and liberation occurs. The Bardo Thodol teaches how we can attain Nirvana by recognizing the
heavenly realms instead of entering into the lower realms where the cycle
of birth and rebirth continue.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The following is a description of the bardo
realms that one travels through after death.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="4">The First 
Bardo</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>The <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib21.html"> first bardo</a> comes at the very moment of death, when there dawns the
<a href="http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html"> Clear Light of the Ultimate
Reality</a>.&nbsp;This is the very content and substance of the state of liberation, if only the soul can recognize it
and act in a way to remain in that state. The instructions intended to be read at the moment of the
person's death are designed to help him do this.  He is told, first of all, to embrace this supreme
experience not in a selfish and egoistic way but rather with love and compassion for all sentient beings.
This will aid him in the second step, which is to realize that his own mind and self is identical with the
Clear Light, implying that he himself IS the Ultimate Reality, "the All-good Buddha", transcending time,
eternity, and all creation. If he can recognize this while in this supreme state at the moment of death, he
will attain liberation-that is, he will remain in the Clear Light forever. This condition is called the
"<a href="http://www.selfknowledge.com/109716.htm">Dharmakaya</a>", the highest spiritual body of the Buddha.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>Most souls, however, will fail to do this. They will be pulled down by the weight of their karma into the
second stage of the first bardo, called the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sunnytees/afterlife22.html"> Secondary Clear Light</a> seen immediately after death.At this
point, there are separate instructions to be read according to the spiritual condition of the person while
in life. For an individual advanced in meditation and other spiritual practices, there is repeated over and
over the same instructions as at the moment of death, enjoining him to recognize himself as the
Dharmakaya.For a person who was still at a student-level on the spiritual path, there is the injunction for
him to meditate on his "tutelary deity", that is, the particular god for whom he performed devotional
practices while alive.  Finally,"if the deceased be of the common folk", unpracticed in any spiritual
disciplines, the instruction is to "meditate upon the Great Compassionate Lord", which is to say an
"Avatar" worshipped by the multitude, equivalent to Jesus as conceived by the average Christian.<br>
<br>
</small></font><b><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="4">The Second 
Bardo</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>If the soul is still not liberated at this stage, it will descend into the
<a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib22.html"> second bardo</a>, which is said to last for
two weeks. The second bardo is also divided into two parts; in the first, the soul of the deceased
encounters what are referred to as "the Peaceful Deities."On each of the seven days, a particular
Buddha-being will appear in radiance and glory, with a bevy of angelic attendants. At the same time, on
each day in turn there will shine a light from one of the six worlds of the Buddhist universe,
called"Lokas"  (the basic meaning is "place";our English words "location" and  "locale" are derived
from the same Sanskrit root).</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>On the first day of the second bardo, there appears to the soul the divine Father-Mother - that is, the
supreme deity of the universe, transcending all dualities, including the division into sexes. The next step
in the destiny of the soul is determined by his reaction to this God. If his life on
Earth  was well lived, he
will now be in a state of purity and grace, and he will enter into the joy of the God and attain liberation. If
on the other hand he has lived an ignoble and impious life, the effects of his bad karma will cause the
intense radiant presence of the God to strike fear and terror in his heart, and he will be drawn instead to
the softer light of the Deva-Loka, which has dawned along with this deity. This is still a fairly attractive
fate, for the Devas are the Gods  (or angels), and their Loka is equivalent to the Christian
heaven;
however, the Buddhist teaching is that even heaven is not the highest spiritual objective, because it is
still only a temporary state in the manifest universe.  Liberation is believed to be the only final and
permanent resting-place for the soul, an un-manifest state beyond all existence.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>On the second day, there appears the
<a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/~kkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/2ndday.html"> second-highest God</a> in the Buddhist pantheon - in fact, he is
actually the Second Person in the literal Buddhist Holy Trinity. At the same time, there dawns a smoky
light from hell;&nbsp;and here we note that, just as the Buddhist heaven is not a permanent, eternal state,
neither is its hell.  Even the most wretched souls will eventually work their way out of even the deepest
pit of hell, just as even the highest and purest souls will eventually lose their footing in
heaven and
descend again into the cycle of death and rebirth. Liberation is the only way out.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>Once again, if the soul responds to the "dazzling white light"of the second God with the joy of a pure
heart, he will be liberated thereby;  but if he specifically reacts with ANGER from having indulged in this
vice on Earth, he will recoil from the light in fear and be drawn into
hell.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>The pattern is repeated on the third day; this time it is the
fault if egotism that will cause the soul to react to the God with fear, and he will be drawn to the human world, where his next incarnation will
thereby take place. On the fourth day dawns the <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/~kkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/4thday.html"> God of Eternal
Life</a>; if the soul has a negative reaction
to him because of miserliness and attachment, he will be drawn toward rebirth in
the <a href="http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/delirium/mythology/pretas.asp">Preta-Loka</a>, a world of"hungry ghosts"who have huge stomachs and throats the size of pinholes, and so they wander
about in a constant state of unsatisfied ravenous desire.  On the fifth day comes God in the form of an
<a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/~kkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/5thday.html">
Almighty Conqueror</a>;  this time it's jealousy that will unseat the soul, and he will be born into
the&nbsp;<a href="http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/buddhism/BGLOSSRY.HTM">Asura-Loka</a>, a world of fierce
warrior-deities&nbsp;(or demons).  On the sixth day all the deities return and
dawn together, along with the lights from all <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/~kkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/6thday.html"> six
Lokas</a>.&nbsp;On the seventh day there appear the <a href="http://kkeys.home.texas.net/~kkeys/spirit/buddhism/bardo/7thday.html">
Knowledge-Holding Deities</a>, who are more fierce and demonic-looking than those that have previously
dawned;and in fact they are sort of a transitional element to the next stage of the second bardo, where
the soul encounters the wrathful deities.  Meanwhile, if because of
stupidity the soul cannot face the Knowledge-Holding Deities, he is drawn toward
the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ramalila.net/Adventures/DeathDyingRebirth/PeterJOnDeath.html">Brute-Loka</a>&nbsp;- that is, he will be reborn on
Earth as
an animal.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>In the second week of the second bardo, the soul meets seven legions of
<a href="http://www.ramalila.net/Adventures/DeathDyingRebirth/RogerOnDeath.html"> Wrathful
Deities</a>:  hideous,
terrifying demons who advance upon him with flame and sword, drinking blood from human skulls,
threatening to wreak unmerciful torture upon him, to maim, disembowel, decapitate and slay him.The
natural tendency, of course, is for the soul to attempt to flee from these beings in stark, screaming,
blood-curdled terror;but if he does, all is lost.  The instructions at this stage of the Bardo are for the soul
to have no fear, but rather to recognize that the Wrathful Deities are really the Peaceful Deities in
disguise, their dark side manifesting as a result of his own evil karma.  The soul is told to calmly face
each demon in turn and visualize it as the deity it truly is, or else as his own tutelary deity; if he can do
this, he will merge with the being and attain the second degree of Liberation, that lesser aspect of it
which is now the best he can hope for here in the second bardo.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>Furthermore, he is told to awaken to
the fact that all these fearsome creatures are not real, but are merely illusions emanating from his own
mind. If he can recognize this, they will vanish and he will be liberated.If he can't, he eventually wanders
down to the third bardo.<br>
<br>
</small></font><b><font face="Verdana" color="#000000" size="4">The Third 
Bardo</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>In the <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib23.html"> third bardo</a> the soul encounters the
<a href="http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/TH57/"> Lord of Death</a>, a fearsome demonic deity who appears in
smoke and fire, and subjects the soul to a Judgment.  If the dead person protests that he has done no
evil, the Lord of Death holds up before him the <a href="http://www.aljardim.com.br/english/bardo.htm"> Mirror of
Karma</a>,&nbsp;"wherein every good and evil act is
vividly reflected." Now demons approach and begin to inflict torments and punishments upon the soul
for his evil deeds. The instructions in the Bardo Thodol are for him to attempt to recognize the
Voidness of all these beings, including the Lord of Death himself; the dead person is told that this entire
scene unfolding around him is a projection from his own mind. Even here he can attain liberation by
recognizing this.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>The soul who is still not liberated after the Judgment will now be drawn remorselessly toward rebirth.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>The lights of the six Lokas will dawn again; into one of these worlds the soul must be born, and the light
of the one he is destined for will shine more brightly than the others.The soul is still experiencing the frightening apparitions and sufferings of the third bardo, and he feels
that he will do anything to escape from this condition. He will seek shelter in what appear to be caves or
hiding-places, but which are actually the entrances to wombs. He is warned of this by the text of the
Bardo Thodol, and urged not to enter them, but to meditate upon the Clear Light instead;  for it is still
possible for him to achieve the third degree of liberation and avoid rebirth.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>Finally there comes a point where it is no longer possible to attain liberation, and after this the soul is
given instructions on how to choose the best womb for a favorable incarnation. The basic method is
non-attachment:to try to rise above both attraction to worldly pleasures and repulsion from worldly ills.</small></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><small>The final words of the&nbsp;Bardo
Thodol&nbsp;are: "Let virtue and goodness be perfected in every way."</small></font></p>
