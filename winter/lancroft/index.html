<h1>Halcion</h1>

<h2>About Lancroft Enterprises</h2>
<p>My father formed the company in 1960, the same year he met my mother. Those were halcyon days. 
Magnetic imaging technology was in its infancy, and the young explorers who arrived first would make a killing.</p>

<!-- https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/halcyon-days.html -->
<p>"The Halcyon is a bird of Greek legend and the name is now commonly given to the European Kingfisher. The ancients believed that the bird made a floating nest in the Aegean Sea and had the power to calm the waves while brooding her eggs. Fourteen days of calm weather were to be expected when the Halcyon was nesting - around the winter solstice, usually 21st or 22nd of December."</p>

<p>Earth's magnetic poles flip, on average, once every 450,000 years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal was 780,000 years ago.
    Fortunately such reversals take over 1,000 years. The process has begun southeast of Austrailia, toward Antarctica.</p>

<p>"Too much matter and energy in one place could cause space to sag so far that the matter inside it would disappear as if behind a magicianâ€™s cloak, collapsing endlessly to a point of infinite density known as a singularity. Einstein thought that idea was ridiculous when it was pointed out to him at the time, in 1916, but today astronomers agree that the universe is speckled with such dark monsters, including beasts lurking in the hearts of most galaxies that are millions and billions of time more massive than the Sun. Many of them resulted from the collapse of dead stars." - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/science/space/a-black-hole-mystery-wrapped-in-a-firewall-paradox.html">NY Times</a></p>

<p>Our main character is the caregiver for her dying husband. 
She sits at his side in the hospital as his mind travels through the muses and demons of his life.</p>

<p>He was aware of her by his side as he drifted in and out of consciousness.</p>

<p>Adorned in feathers attached to a nylon parachute outfit, 
the crew is filming a scene for a television show which reproduces a 
Mayan blood letting ritual - a practice that allowed the priests and priestesses 
to communicate with their ancestors by inhaling blood from Ayahuasca soaked ropes 
in the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>

Before the husband took ill, the couple had made their wealth producing realty TV shows which focused on bringing together brilliant minds from science, business and exploration. They placed them in beautiful environments with drinks and abundant muses to tempt and inspire while the world tuned in weekly to watch the groups talk, argue and come up with inspired ideas to solve world problems.<br><br>

<p>The couple was constantly busy juggling work, travel and the needs of their children. 
Ultimately it was their own lives that were most in need of solutions.</p>

She was not always happy, but the stories they told made the world feel young again, like children, so it was well worth the ride.  And with a whoshhh he was airborne, flying high over the Caribbean blue below, forever lost, as most husbands seem to be.<br><br>
