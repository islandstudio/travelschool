<p>There are two reactions, the first feuled by combustion, the second by the inward pull of the vacuum which remains in its wake.</p>

                “The cleverness of hiding something in plain sight has been around for many years,” he said. “However, this is exceptionally brilliant because these templates are so widely used that people are desensitized to them, and because this text is so widely distributed that no one bothers to question why, how and where it might have come from.” -

        Years later, when I realized Tess had been reciting Lorem Ipsum, I told Derek 
        about the weird incident. Derek's design group at FitBit still used Lorem Ipsum occasionally. 

        We pondered about how pervasive those lines of latin had become?  Did anyone take the time to read the original source. So odd that something could repeat in so many places, yet have no meanin in itself.  
        What other patterns occurred across the entire spectrum of media, print, digital? But rarely audio. Were there similar repating patterns in coding? DNA itself was sort of pattern that perpetuated forward with ever so slight changes over millenia.
        </p>

        <p>
        Was there something unique to the moral lesson of Lorem Ipsum that made it unique to this planet? Pulled by the moon, a fractured orb called Earth where only those with a firm will survived? Or did the repeating and mutating pattern mean nothing, just more noise in an otherwise slow fade into planetary oblivion.

<p>Hey Izzy, did you ever dock in?  I'll be kayaking nearby on the way to the Island.</p>

<p>A tea can keep you in a space, and not wake you up.</p>

<p>Mark and I were near an imposibly high mountain range for the location - Mobile, Alabama.  We was painting and we focused on the subletness of one small curve at the end of a line.  The other two branch of a triangular set of lies each had a dual branch at the end.  This line only had one branch at the end, so I wondered why he would choose to angle it to the right rather than the left.</p>

<p>"You know, it doesn't really matter now.  I had them hooked with the free giveaway."</p>

<p>We'd come to mobile as part of Mark's "Influencing Hearts and Minds" show.  He had been embraced by the highest eshelons of both the art culture and the movers and shakers.</p>

<p>Soon we'll be leaving to return home to our families.  The nude girls shift as Mark pulls out another small canvas.</p>

<p>I look up at the mountains, impossibly large for this area near the beach.  And I'm thinking how much I'd like to climb them.  To expore the forests and babbling brooks high in their peaks.  Their fractal form isn't really of this earth.  They are strange and unduating, a contrast to the smooth form of the breasts in front of me, young, delectible, tantilizing.</p>

<p>I watch Marks paintbrush dabbing in the pinks and reds to create the colors of her nipple, small and abstract on the 4" by 4" canvas.</p>

<p>The military themes of Mark's larger collection of recent paintings were an instant hit.  The aircraft carrier and the soldier portrait.  He describes how the show is transformational, how modern art is the pathway to racial acceptance.  I'm not sure I get it.  We're thinking about the housewives. "Appearently they're getting what they need on the weekdays" mark says, "but not always on the weekends."  Mark's art opens up a new avenue for their satisfaction on the weekends, when they spend time with their husbands.</p>

<p>I still don't really get it, but I can see how the crowds responded, and I imagine that many a couple went home to marital bliss with the wine served running through their libidos.</p>

<p>Mark and I are under a bridge now as we start to return home.  It's a long underpass, and we are sitting beside eachother on a stone wall while reflecting on the show and cultural change. It's been a fun week, the old friends and all the comings and going of the art world. 
</p>

<p>"You know, culture never really changes.  The push and pull is always there.  The center of gravity shifts around, but the same forces continues to reside and subside."  Combustion, vacuum, collapse, collide, swish, swirl.  curls.</p>


<h1>Crossing the Alps</h1>

<p>There are two reactions,<br>
the first fueled by combustion,<br>
the second by the inward pull of the vacuum<br>
which remains in its wake.</p><br>

<p>
Crossing the Alps, carrying moss, a scar-like tattoo on his shoulder. The butterfly blade patterns, two edges of the cresant moons.</p>

<p>He is traveling north to return to his tribe, a small stone carving dangles around his neck. He travels long hours to bring back medicinal plants from across the mountains.</p>

<p>Investigators would later refer to the marks as the butterfly blade because the edges of the mark curve inward at the center.  Erin is a friend of Wu, a man with the same butterfly blade wound markings.</p>

<p>In his pouch, below the moss, he carries a stone. 
</p>

<p class="local" style="display:none">
    The stone's structure rings with the carbon imprint of a planet's entire tree of DNA across time, formed from their ashes, navigated by their dreams. <!--To find the stone, try looking in the cabin full of steam in the founder's earliest dream.-->
</p>

<p>
Now he comes down the grassy hills, descending from the mountains, finally home. And there she is, surrounded by men, who worship and build for her.  And build they do. Mighty henges and ships from the massive trees of the northern forests.  The elephants along side, providing strength and shelter.</p>

<br>


<p>Izzy and I were near an impossibly tall mountain range for the location<!--- Mobile, Alabama-->. We were painting and we focused on the subtleness of one small curve at the end of a line. The other two branches of a triangular set of lines each had a dual branch at the end. This line only had one branch at the end, so I wondered why he would choose to angle it to the right rather than the left.</p>

<p>"You know, it doesn't really matter now."</p>

<p>I look up at the mountains, still impossibly large.  Their fractal form clearly isn't of this earth, and I'm thinking how much I'd like to climb them again, to explore the forests and babbling brooks high in their peaks. They are strange and undulating, in contrast to the smooth water lapping at my feet.</p>

<p>I watch his paintbrush dabbing in the pinks and reds to create the colors of a nipple, small and abstract, surrounded in black, on the 4 by 4 inch canvas.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your patience in traversing this line." a hand written sign reads by the path along the beach to our left. "We have a tremendous amount of new content in various stages of completion. Please return again and we're sure you'll find something new to meet your pleasures."</p>

<p>Just for kicks, I flip back to the movie trailer.</p>

<p>TRAILER 1</p>

<p>"The same people were trying to find different gods, and I think they did."</p>

<p>The oracle moved up the mountain, wraped and hidden.  Calling for no one.  Answering in a warm, glowing orb.</p>

<p>"Your thoughts," she began, "they run away with you now, until you are no longer sure which came from the actual past, and which are fabricated from the many colliding influences around you."</p>

<p>The oracle (Erin) turned over the delicate cloth <!--mushroom--> in her hand.</p>

<p>"Awareness is rooted in the past, the past is always there, in the middle of your present, you're standing on a house of cards.  Undo the right card, and the past is now.  That's not possible with the future. You can't fall forward into the future, but you can set a trap that will send the future falling back to you. A permanent time marker, so to speak."<p>

<p>"I want you."</p>

<p>She seemed caught off guard.</p>

<p>"How so?" she replied.</p>

<p>Finn replied, "Create a complex entanglement, a riddle with only one unfolding path back to the source.  One route back to origin from many points." Finn sets aside the book in his hand.</p>

<p>"And what becomes of the future when it falls back to the past?" Erin asked him in her manner of teaching with questions.</p>

<p>"It gets a good rest.  It sees itself from a new angle. It reaches a moment of satori, sighs and realigns its perspective, rather like a flipping of a planet's polarity, or a flap of a wing."</p>

<p>Erin smiled. "Like flipping a switch."</p>

<p>Finn replied. "Like flipping a switch."</p>

<p>TRAILER 2</p>

<p>1959, Gentry Williamns had been tracking a female spy who had latched on to one of the U2 mechs in Turkey shortly before the illfated flight.  Most everyone thought she was a local girl.  Problem is, Gentry also fell in love.  And after a short bit of shuffle, she returned to the family farm with him in 1963.</p>

<p>We'll never know if she loved him the same, they lasted a good solid eight years.  But when special circumstances called, she was gone, leaving her boy in the care of Gentry's sister.  I'm sure it tore her up.  Wild horses.</p>

<p>In 2016, physicists at Princeton University and UC Santa Barbara's Station Q independently proved that a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170126120502.htm">time crystal</a> could be made within the lab. According to co-author Norman Yao, UC Berkeley was "the bridge between the theoretical idea and the experimental implementation" in fabricating this new non-equilibrium phase of matter.</p>

<p>In 2018, physicists uncovered hints of a time crystal in the last place they expected: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180502120013.htm" target="monoammonium-phosphate">a child's toy</a> monoammonium phosphate (MAP) in a children's crystal growing kit.</p>

<h2>Bandwave Jumping</h2>


<p>Hey Izzy, did you ever dock in? I'll be kayaking nearby on the way to the island.</p>

<p>Tea can keep you in a space, and not wake you up.</p>

<p>We'd come to Mobile as part of Izzy's "Influencing Hearts and Minds" show. He had been embraced by the highest echelons of both the art culture and the movers and shakers.</p>

<p>Soon we'll be leaving to return home to our families. The girls shift as Izzy pulls out another small canvas.</p>

<p>I look up at the mountains, impossibly large for this area near the beach. And I'm thinking how much I'd like to climb them. To expore the forests and babbling brooks high in their peaks. Their fractal form isn't really of this earth. They are strange and undulating, a contrast to the smooth smiling faces enjoying the sun on the deck of the boat around us.</p>

<p>I watch Izzy's paintbrush dabbing in the pinks and reds, small and abstract on the tablet's canvas.</p>

<p>Izzy and the group pass under a bridge now as we head up the river to return home.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about you now as I daze in the evening sun, reflecting on cultural change. Polite, acknowledging the complexities of emotion and friendship. It's part of that transformational art scene. I'm comfortably uptight, enough to protect my sense of self. There's a mutual push and pull in our relationship and the unfolding events. The models, being away from home, the urge to caress with a paint brush. There's always a need for balance in this grey area, half asleep on the ride home.</p>

<p>I like how here, under the bridge, is part of a passing through. It's been a fun week, my writing and all the comings and goings. I'm admittedly a little attention starved. I stand up and pull Izzy to his feet with me. I'm thinking about the scene where I was riding in the car with Mrs. Daisy early in the trip, and the anonymous every-woman in the red dress. Wondering if she and I would have been pulling over at this same bridge to look down at the water. Here now, under the bridge, the dirt is hard, the ground is dry on the side embankment and no plants are growing in the darkness.</p>

<p>And there it is, the cave that leads into your soul, not far from the water's edge.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for traveling this far. You should turn back now. I think you may have missed, or dropped, something along the way. We've only just begun to know each other, and I wouldn't want to take you on a path you're not completely prepared for.</p>
