<h1>The Cast</h1>

<pre>
The Party - A loose-knit group of real world hypercell builders:

Audrey Zoome (Aurora)

Amber Wave

Finn Maker (Mike) - Leader of the aquatic robot collective. The Founder.

Erin (11) - Expert on AI Systems. The Oracle.

Bryn - The mermaid. The diver and mechanical expert. (Africa)

Coda - The coder (Ecuador)

Carl - The physicist (Chicago)

Jill Avervance - Delta investigator, Journalist, Biologist

Hudson Greenich - A force of nature
</pre>

<p>
Lucus (Will) - Loki the frail birdman, the patient, the truthsayer, seemingly the devil but really a saint. How can you be the last of the birdmen? How can you be the last of the neutrino dancers? I was heart broken. There he sat, legs crossed. Lost in contemplation. "I have traveled a great way, crossed many lands, and yet here I will perish and none will follow."  Raised by a single mother
</p>


<p>Dylan McMillian - Science minded, eventual creator of first full-size quantum pulse.</p>

<p>David Ipsum (Izzy) - Michael's friend and nemesis. The omnipotent one. (The Father AI) Recognizing his own weaknesses, David sets the course for Michael's independence.</p>

<p>(David) Ipsum - The supposed author. Never seen, always present. You can do this. An adopted father for a fatherless child. A purest with his own ankst. The king, The doctor, The slain one. One with David. Jack Black as the devil. Tom Sawyer. The Buddha. Lorum Ipsm is a note that David wrote to himself, and pasted all over the world for easy access to recall the prior game. He is the analytical, but relies on Lucus's ability to dream.</p>

<p>Lord Autha - The actual story teller, whose avatar is Willx</p>

<p>Jon - a writer who sought hard-to-reach places to create click-bait.</p>

<p>Michael - Their uncle, Lucendia's lover</p>

<p>Tangle, Warf and Wu - A multidimensional being, most often embodied as my rasta warrior self.</p>



<p>Running Man - Laurence Oliver</p>

<p>Alexander Silvermen, Arron Knife, and Marcus Clemens</p>


<p>Is there more to the world around us?</p>

<p>"Of course, knot."</p>

<h2>Laying out the Challenge</h2>

<p>Michael had no shortage of big ideas and he tended to plunge right in, regardless of the time or temperature, which helped explaned why he was 5,000 miles from home in the middle of a frozen polar night, with near frostbiten toes and negative 50° winds howling at the door.</p>

<!--
<p>&quot;And you think the network will fund scientific projects? When penguins fly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, the entity I'm talking about is no longer a news organization. It's an organization for shaping priorities and laying out a course of action, pursuing societal goals based on science and the latest discoveries.&quot;</p>
-->


<p>&quot;No, no, this is somethine more, outside the network, a group capable of taking risks to set agendas.&quot;</p>
<p>Marcus russled is his sleeping bag by Jon's feet, &quot;Ask one to become one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think about the great challenges funded by prize money, the offroad robotic car challenge for one million, the low earth orbit challenge for ten million.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I like the challenge part. So you're talking more about a research organization.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The challenges make for interesting science stories - but the short news cycle of the networks typically leaves out the human element, so the stories lose their luster fast. What we need is exclusives with key players in order to justify even bigger upfront expense. If we can spend 250 million on a movie, why not roll that into truely ground breaking exploration by finding the right people to move it forward?&quot;</p>

<p>Starting to get the direction, George sat up on the other side of the tent, &quot;We need the insiders on our team so we can ride out the story to it's conclusion, to build the drama and really draw in an audience - our exclusive audience and not one that gets stolen by another network that comes late to the game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly, the Mars One mission is the perfect example. Few opportunities for interlopers there, no other networks sheparding away the stars for other interviews - we control the news feed and the news flow. We create the story and we reap the rewards.&quot;</p>
<p>Jon responded, &quot;Sounds like there's a big opportunity for a story to backfire, I mean we're a news organization, not a bunch of professors. How do we make sure we're making the right choices?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how does the network avoid getting sued if the wrong choice is made?&quot; Now Marcus was sitting up too.</p>

<p>&quot;Easy, we let experts within our audience make the final choices on which directions to pursue, and we shield the network from liability by running the opperation as a unique entity. Let the public think we're an independent foundation, let them be involved directly in the effort.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For us, the prize money is viewership, but only if we land on the right story. The type of story that engages the world. We need to take risks, but to do that we need to rely on the sleuthing of independents, of &quot;privateers.&quot; We need eyes and ears on the ground that don't trace back to us - until they land the right story. Then we drive forward quickly with big money to make things happen fast - while we still have mindshare.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who's going to lead the front organization?&quot; Jon pondered. They looked at each other, than at David laying silently on the floor.</p>

<p>David Ipsum, the fifth member of their group had slept silently while they talked, or so it would seem. The group would need a director with an even keel, a guiding star to sync up their orbits, pull in high rollers while adhereing to democratic principals throughout the process. David, calm and collective, was the perfect choice to balance Michael's more chaotic approach.</p>

<p>And thus Eye of the Hurricane (EOH) was born, the name pulled from their early days working together chasing storms.</p>

<p>The five laid out the details of their organization and began coming up with project ideas during their remaining week on the frozen plateau.</p>

<p>Across the ice, David watched two reporters from another network slogging off toward the center of the massive continent.  They'd been at it for several days.</p>

<p>Those FOX news guys are trying to bring back a penguin that wondered inland (to die) so they can test for brain abnormalities. "It's humping all the dead penguins it comes across as it marches south!" Jon shouted over the wind. <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/159056055.html" target="penguin1" rel="nofollow nofollow">Penguin Blog</a><br>

<p>"It's such a circus, just let them go." I shouted back.</p>

<p>A massive storm would be on them around night fall.</p>

<p>"We'll continue to monitor with the heat sensor, if things look bleak we'll send out the rover, but it's doubtful we could get to them in time, even if we started now."</p>

<p>Antarctica was a harsh mistress.  Not a space for playing around, the gale force winds combined with the intense cold would quickly deep-freeze anyone foolish enough to come unpreparred.</p>

<p>Why on earth had they themselves left their wives 5,000 miles away for this, every year!</p>

<p>A story Matt McGraph prepared for the BBC explained the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18370797" target="penguin2" rel="nofollow nofollow">behavior of the penguins</a>, "What is happening there is not in any way analogous to necrophilia in the human context," interviewee Dougald Russell said. "It is the males seeing the positioning that is causing them to have a sexual reaction.</p>

<p>"They are not distinguishing between live females who are awaiting congress in the colony, and dead penguins from the previous year which just happen to be in the same position."
</p>

<p>Leave it to Fox news to send in these poor guys on the edge of a storm, a pair of modern day Rosencrantz and Guildensterns.</p>

<p><a href="/travelschool/sun/on-the-run/">On the run - continued</a></p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>Over the next week, they drew up a list of the cutting edge science that would be wound into the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Gravity and Extreme Magnetism SMEX</strong> (<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_and_Extreme_Magnetism_SMEX">GEMS</a></strong>)<br />
Canceled due to cost overruns during the design process, GEMS was now ready for implementation thanks to a crowdsourced design effort.  EOH would focus media attention to get the project back on the government's flight list.</p>

<p>Things were going well, until... she arrived. He'd been thinking about her off and on, wondering if she would come, thinking about her smile as they poured over the week of planning.</p>

<p>A world of freelancers would emerge, seeking out stories to pitch to the big networks. Often times getting into tricky situations to &quot;push the news&quot; - to find and create stories that would captivate the worlds.</p>
<p>The group would tell the public that the funding came from Michael's father, hence the name Lancroft Foundation was chosen. Laurence Lancroft had passed away many years prior, leaving him a small trust in a Swiss account. It would be the perfect cover for establishing a larger pool of funds drawn indirectly from people in powerful places desiring news influence.</p>
<p>Several years later...</p>
<p>Chris peered around the corner, the tiny metalic object in his hand, streching his arm around the corner and placing it on the side of the wall. A dozen tiny feet moved gently to find crevaces to hold the small robot on the ancient wall. Like a bug, it moved toward a small opening in the bricks and into the darkness.</p>
<p>Do you see it?</p>
<p>Yes, I see it!</p>
<p>What do you see?</p>
<p>Wonderful things...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>David's father was a founder of the <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread763342/pg1">Tiger's Eye Society</a> in 1922<br></p>

<div>"As the eons fly by, the orbits of the three outer planets expand outward, and the belt of planetesimals spread out a bit. But all hell breaks loose just after the chronometer reaches 878 million years. It's then, as Littmann explains in the article, that Saturn and Jupiter reach a 2:1 orbital resonance. The gravitational tugs from Jupiter accumulate to greatly alter Saturn's orbit. With Saturn on the move, this in turn shifts the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which plunge into the planetesimal reservoir, scattering bodies like the police arriving at a high-school house party."</div>

<p><b>Alternative ending</b></p>

You have to understand, that I'm here to be with you, not to compete with you.

Michael spread out the bandana of tightly tied kerchiefs, each a different story level. Nine in all. Across his lap and through his hands.

Then suddenly, almost without thinking, he reached over and gave the wheel a jerk.

The car spun and David was cast out onto the sand.

What'd you do that for?!!

For everything! For Shela, for Alexi, and mostly Coda!

"You mean all nine?"" He paused, "Yes, that's all my doing. Here, take it. It's yours now."
<!--p>Bastard!!!!!</p-->

But it was too late, Michael had coiled around, pivoting his back and flung his arms out wide and unwound like a pinwheel. In a solid, gyroscopic whirl he was sailing out over the cliff in free-fall.
<!--
<p>Score: Coldplay, Talk</p>
-->

One hand, fingers unfolding and spreading wide and, wait, in the other hand he held the memory stone. David had thrust it there before he spun over him.

His boot smacked David under the chin, but as David spun in the low gravity he spun - and smacked the memory stone directly into my hand.

Now as I fell, I was falling through matter, through time, through consciousness. I had become the sum.

And with each fall there was a collision, but this time with each impact there was a sudden wave of awareness passing directly though the wave of impact. Through each framework of the story. Each descent was a life and they were infinite. Over and over and over, without a set direction in time, but with a tremendously logical set of stories that played out over and over like a grand symphony, rising and falling. Sometimes minor pieces, sometimes major threads, each wound together. And where they crossed, there were choices! I didn't catch on at first, so overwhelmed by the sheer immersion, but there at each denumoi, peak of action, there was a multitude of outcomes. These were the roots and from the roots a new story would unfold, cycling me back up into the upper branches from which I would again fall into the heart, into the sun, but how, and why. What the hell was going on?!
