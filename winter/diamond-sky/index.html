    I look at these quantum physicists and think they have to be bisexual to wrap their heads around such widely desperate concepts.

<h3>Diamond Storms - Overview</h3>

<p>Jon called me over to the spectrograph. We had picked up an unusual signal from a battleship ship. An Iranian ship was using frame-shifting to realign the bow and stern. It was warping space to use the surrounding ocean waves. The spectrograph dove through a Mandelbrot succession of shapes.</p>
<p>Last night, we were high up in a tree over some water at a university.  A skinny black man, with the build of your friend who went camping with us, decided to fall into the water below.  He spread out his arms christ-like as he was falling backwards through the branches.  The water below was very shallow, about a foot and half deep.  The impact dazed him and his cell phone and other items flew out of his pockets - the items were then stolen  while we watched from above.</p>
<p>And then an impression for an ending while waking: Jon through his leg over the fence, he'd won the challenge. It's a white picket fence of course. (ala Tom Sawyer - the next movie we're watching)</p>

The first question that comes to mind is who is running the hologram? Or who created it? Could this be a hologram within a hologram? Does this theory then hint towards intelligent design?

Well, if you look at the article on the cosmic microwave background, you may get to the realisation that the hologram is part of a simulation with a logo embossed in it - which is why the map looks the way it does. And that we are, all of us, sims. As to whether the design was intelligent or not - well that decision rests with who/whatever is grading the assignments. I feel another Futures story coming on...B-)

<h2>The Dane</h2>
<p>There are two languages I love the sound of Norwegian and Hindi. What a rare delight to hear them combined tonight here in the high Himalas.</p>

<p>An invitation arrived in the mail today: Dinner at PengLai</p>

<p>"You have to find tranquility from the storm. Everyone will
have their own path, their own story."</p>

<p>This story wouldn't have been possible without the research support of my friend Bjarne Larzen<!--Lorenzen creator of Science27.com-->, a Scandinavian student of my father's who would became like a brother to me over the years of travel and study.</p>

<p>It is indeed a strange and fractured story, but I think we've done a pretty good job of pulling the pieces togehter here for your perusal.</p>
<br>

<p>To organize...</p>

<p>In the previous novel, our main character realizes that he is in a hospital, unsure 
			if he is dead or dying.  In his dream, he has plummeted into the mud.
			</p>

<p>A retelling of the call to Jena, from David's side of the
call.Ê He is in Mobile, Alabama, working on preparation for the forthcoming
production.Ê Rain has already arrived at his location.</p>

<p>We are building toward the hurricane Ð David calls Jenni for
some essential piece of information. (You are like a Hurricane.)Ê David is the
producer, calling the shots, arranging the attendees.Ê Setting Michael up for the
program.Ê The four members of Magna head: Michael, Willem (recruited later), Mark
and David.Ê Izzy is hence reserved as the creator.Ê It was an old fashioned
band of married men, looking up to me for encouragement.Ê (We never reveal who
stands in as the stunt falice.Ê Showing the faces of the four men separately.)</p>

<p>Michael is calling Jena at night, after her long day climbing
on the butterfly hills with her family.</p>

<p>(Earlier in the day, a group of families were hiking up a
steep hill to see where the butterflies stay for the winter (described in an
earlier chapter).Ê One of the families is led by a mother, Jena.Ê Followed by
her daughter and husband.Ê Jena is pregnant, but still has the most energy and
coaxes on her worn out family.Ê Soon their tired spirits turn to elation as the
butterflies take flight, the daughter spinning with arms out stretched.Ê A bird
watches as she spins around like Coda did thousands of years before.)</p>

<p>That night it rains while the family is sleeping down in the
village in a room beside the town square. </p>

<p>ÊJena is woken by a frantic call from her friend Michael.</p>

<p>Michael (a technician) who rattles on about the &quot;Eye of
Saturn&quot;, describing a huge hexagon shape found on the north pole of
Saturn.Ê Jena attended college with Michael and David.Ê They spent a summer as
interns working in the physics lab together, many late nights.Ê They knew eachother's
quirks well.</p>

<p>David steps in, "we have a question to ask you about the
project photos."</p>

<p>David always had the level head, but Michael had the passion. They were a good team.</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to seeing you guys again. It won't be long."</p>

<p>Jena was accustomed to getting calls from Michael with his
hair-brained ideas. By the time Jena is able to fall back asleep, noises of
people are heard from the drizzly cobblestone streets.Ê Participants are
beginning to gather for the annual Day of the Dead celebrations.</p>

<p>Amid the colorful crowds on the street, we see clothing
similar to Coda's, and (maybe)flash back to see her giving Loka the Memory
Stone, a round jade stone shaped like a torus.Ê Voices are heard in the
distance.Ê She places the stone into Loka's hand and wraps his fingers around
it.Ê She kisses him and bids him farewell.Ê He turns, glancing back and begins
to run through the jungle.Ê Men from another tribe are coming.</p>

The <a href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=57684&CultureCode=en">2008 excavations at Hohle Fels Cave</a> in the Swabian Jura of southwestern Germany recovered a female figurine carved from mammoth ivory from the basal Aurignacian deposit. This figurine <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=The+Venus+of+Hohle+Fels">The Venus of Hohle Fels</a>, which is the earliest depiction of a human, and one of the oldest known examples of figurative art worldwide, was made at least 35,000 years ago. This discovery radically changes our views of the context and meaning of the earliest Paleolithic art.

An off-centered, but carefully carved ring is located above the broad shoulders of the figurine. This ring, despite being weathered, preserves polish suggesting that the figurine was worn as a pendant.
 
The pendant was found broken in six pieces.

<p>My architect friend Jill and I have been traveling to a foreign country to talk with a beautiful old artist. Perhaps she's Greek. Tonight we returned, and we were with a tour group. There's a Joni Michele song to this theme.</p>

<pre>I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me</pre>

<p>Google headquaters is in this foreign country and their offices are like an art museum. Every piece is in black and white, large inside white galleries that open into halls that open into work areas.  Jill and I are walking down halls and through work areas in portions of the headquarters off the tour.  I'm trying to do that look, where you glance around at a new environment but still appear like you're supposed to be there. We walk past a standing woman talking to others by a desk, and a dark curly haired man. I think they know we're not workers, but Jill always comes across official, almost regal.</p>

<p>Layers: I just figured out the design for my house (well, almost - moved the stairs to the north side), an open pull-in area with a stairway on the north side.  Two small short stairways into the deeper basement.  The stairway to the upstairs is on the far wall, same angle as the one below.  Yesterday was the 5th of July, at Isac's house on the lake. Listened to Joni Michele the last two days. Her songs still feel new to me since I never emmerseed myself in her music. She reminds me of a northern california ideal of grace. I glace around to find it in Greenville on the fourth of July and decide that my daughter Abbey personifies it well. I let them get a touch too much sun, but not so much that they will blister.</p>

If Himalayan monks find you almost dead, I'll ask them to check to see if you have a Hofstadter Butterfly pattern across your chest.

Dieter Jaksch, a physicist at the University of Oxford, UK, says, “I expect that a wealth of new phenomena and insights will be found when exploring the butterfly.”

A Jewel at the Heart of Quantum Physics

"There is no space-time, there is no quantum mechanics, there is something else, and they emerge hand in hand."

Johnny Wheeler (John Archibald Wheeler) coined the terms "black hole" and "wormhole." Later he conjectured to Richard Feynman that all

Feynman's diagrams are the 100 to 500 page calculations that Nima Hamed's amplituhedron reduces to 1 page. 

Hamed's held off on showing the last slide in this lecture. I'm wondering what he's holding back on?  Maybe we'll get some backing for Johnny Wheeler one-electron universe conjecture, the concept that inspired Richard Feynman to create all those massive equations in the first place.

Building a quantum computer from one photon, and mirrors.  

Quantum Computer Uses Photons as Qubits - the system allows "light photons from an atom to interact with their own mirror image reflections. Photons that the atom emits are reflected by the mirror and can interact again with the atom but with a very slight time delay"

Systems of particles adapt their structures to become better at dissipating energy.

How does life differ from rocks?
Life is better at capturing energy from their environment and dissipating that energy as heat.

THe dissipation-driven adaptation of matter.

second law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of increasing entropy or the “arrow of time.” Hot things cool down. (Energy tends to disperse or spread out as time progresses. Entropy is a measure of this tendency, quantifying how dispersed the energy is among the particles in a system.)

"The overall entropy of the universe increases during photosynthesis as the sunlight dissipates, even as the plant prevents itself from decaying by maintaining an orderly internal structure."

"As entropy production increases,... a system’s behavior becomes more and more “irreversible.”

England's new theory applies when:
"The systems are strongly driven by an external energy source such as an electromagnetic wave, and they can dump heat into a surrounding bath. This class of systems includes all living things."

“This means clumps of atoms surrounded by a bath at some temperature, like the atmosphere or the ocean, should tend over time to arrange themselves to resonate better and better with the sources of mechanical, electromagnetic or chemical work in their environments,” England explained.


"Scientists have already observed self-replication in nonliving systems. According to new research led by Philip Marcus of the University of California, Berkeley, and reported in <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.084501">Physical Review Letters</a> in August, vortices in turbulent fluids spontaneously replicate themselves by drawing energy from shear in the surrounding fluid. And in a paper appearing online this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Michael Brenner, a professor of applied mathematics and physics at Harvard, and his collaborators present theoretical models and simulations of microstructures that self-replicate. These clusters of specially coated microspheres dissipate energy by roping nearby spheres into forming identical clusters. “This connects very much to what Jeremy is saying,” Brenner said.""

This made me think of Into the Cool as some others have noted but there are probably a number of others.
However, I think there is a missing piece in these theories- information. Living systems accumulate and preserve information. Information allows reproduction, evolution, and even metabolism.


"A billion years from now our descendants may have discovered other systems of physical life such as plasma within stars which would be based on the reciprocal influence of patterns of magnetic force and the ordered motion of charged particles. In fact, such life may well exist within our Sun."
