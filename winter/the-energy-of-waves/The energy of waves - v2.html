The Inuit man paddles harder and harder, left, right, left, right.  On the edge of air and water, his kayak glides past walls of ice and rocky outcroppings.  Faster and faster, with each even stroke accelerating the craft on the smooth surface away from the turbulent shoreline.

It’s been a whole season since I’ve written.  Tax season, than summer and work season to pay the bills.  In two days new year’s arrives.

This morning I awoke with the paddling man in my mind’s eye.  Gliding along the icy artic coast, he hears the voice of an elder in his mind.   &#8220;When you traverse the surface between elements, you can travel faster than through either element alone.&#8221;

This summer we traveled, and traveled.  Up the coast of Maine, and bought a kayak.

When I paddle near the massive outcropping, my efforts are slowed.  I’m buffeted by waves that bounce off the rocks and set my boat rocking, back and forth counter to my efforts.  It is not until I adjust my strokes to use the rocking to my advantage, then I can actually use the rhythmic waves to increase my speed.   This adjustment is secret to many things.

Yesterday I found another guest to invite, Chinese astronomer Sheng Zhao.

tensor-vector-scalar gravity (TeVeS) – a 'simple' formula that explicitly tells how gravity should behave in the transition zone between the solar system, where the golden laws of Newton and Einstein apply, and the outskirts of galaxies.  It’s a MOND theory that works perfectly for most galaxies.  But it has yet to explain the bullet cluster.

&#8220;Under MOND, mass is much more effective at bending space-time than under General Relativity, so it takes less stuff in the universe to account for all the gravity we measure.  When applied to just galaxies, MOND can predict very well the behavior that astronomers observe. But when MOND is applied to larger structures like clusters of galaxies, it fails. To make MOND work for clusters, it must include more complicated concepts, such as entities called dark fields, which are different from dark matter, but work in a similar way to alter the amount of gravity present.&#8221;

In the inuit villiage, a group of colorfully dressed children are winding ribbons around a May pole.  

The celebration has ended and the older boys have the task of removing the pole.  The first two tug and push to no avail, stuck in the frozen permafrost.  A third, approaches the pole and sets his hand on it and gives a little push.  Then another and soon the top of the pole is vibrating back and forth as the pole slowly rises out of the permafrost muck.

1/19/2010 - The energy of waves - v2

Tensor–vector–scalar gravity (TeVeS) is a disputed theory of modified gravity that accounts for the flat rotation curves of galaxies. The TeVeS theory requires massive neutrinos, hot dark matter to make the equations work. I still believe.

From Encounters at the End of the World (2007): Out on frozen sea-ice, the two tallest buildings on Antarctica are located -- hangers which scientists are using to launch giant balloons 40 kilometers into the stratosphere to search for almost undetectable subatomic particles -- neutrinos. The Neutrino Detection Project, led by Dr. Peter Gorham, a physicist from the University of Hawaii, wants to be the first scientific group to detect the highest energy neutrinos in the universe. He excitedly gushes (though still struggles finding the words to describe something he's only beginning to understand): "The neutrino is the most ridiculous particle you can imagine. ...They exist, but we can't get our hands on them, because they seem to just exist in another place. ...And, as a physicist, even though I understand it mathematically, and I understand it intellectually, it still hits me in the gut that there is something here, surrounding me, almost like some kind of spirit or God, that I can't touch, but I can measure it. I can make a measurement. It's like measuring the spirit world, or something like that..."

Through our eyes the universe is perceiving itself… – Alan Watts

Excerpt from I'll follow the Sun (2011):

Five years later, and one month earlier, at the opposite pole....  

The Inuit man paddles harder and harder, left, right, left, right. On the edge of air and water, his kayak glides past walls of ice and rocky outcroppings. Faster and faster, with each even stroke accelerating the craft on the smooth surface away from the turbulent shoreline.

As I paddle, near the massive outcropping, my efforts are slowed. I’m buffeted by waves that bounce off the rocks and set my boat rocking, back and forth counter to my efforts.

Back in the Inuit villiage, a group of colorfully dressed children are winding ribbons around a May pole.  Braiding colors to a circling rhythm.

The celebration has ended and the older boys have the task of removing the pole. The first two tug and push to no avail, stuck in the frozen permafrost.  A third, approaches the pole and sets his hand on it and gives a little push. Then another gentle push, and another, and soon the top of the pole is vibrating back and forth, as the bottom of the pole slowly rises out of the permafrost muck.

Back and forth, back and forth. Pole to pole.

&#8220;Neutrinos are electrically neutral leptons, and interact very rarely with matter. When they do react with the molecules of water in the ice, they can create charged leptons (electrons, muons, or taus). These charged leptons can, if they are energetic enough, emit Cherenkov radiation. This happens when the charged particle travels through the ice faster than the speed of light in the ice, similar to the bow shock of a boat traveling faster than the waves it crosses. This light can then be detected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) within the digital optical modules (or DOMs) making up IceCube. Even though it is located in Antarctica, IceCube is more sensitive to point sources more in the northern hemisphere than the southern. It can observe astrophysical neutrino signals from any direction, but in the southern hemisphere these neutrinos are swamped by the downgoing cosmic-ray muon background.&#8221;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory
