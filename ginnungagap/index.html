<p>&#8220;I have to do what?! You have to be kidding me.&#8221; Willem says
into the phone.</p>

<p>David replies, &#8220;It’s what you signed up for, the Mayan New
Year’s ritual.  We reached our one millionth backer this morning.&#8221;  (Many
contributed $2.99 to purchase an app.)</p>

<p>According to Norse myths, the world is formed of nine
independent realms, each joined to the world tree Yggdrasill.  Together they
arise from the bottomless abyss call Ginnungagap (the great emptiness).  An
eagle sits atop the world tree, the world serpent coils around its roots.</p>

<p>A destination, a wavelength, a band of thought.</p>

<p>An eagle sits atop Yggdrasill, the world serpent coils
around her roots – similar cosmologies are found throughout the world.  </p>

<p>I’m pondering if each world represents a wavelength of
thought or emotion, with the longer, deeper waves being the more transcendent. 
</p>

<p>Song, while working shelves: Magic
Flow, Shamanic, By Anugama</p>

<p>I read that the same tree cosmology is found throughout the
world – from Asia to the Americas.  In each legend, a bird sits atop the tree
and the world serpent coils around the roots.  The Maya combined the image of
the tree with a serpent to invoke their ancestors – burning their blood on a
barbed vine as incense.  I suspect the vines contained the dream inducing
chemical DMT, since similar experiences are commonly reported  today – seeing
serpents and conversing with multiple levels of intellect.</p>

<p>The Norse tale of nine realms reminded me of this video
where a mathematician describes experiencing &quot;multiple bands in a spectrum
of speeds&#8221; when using DMT.  The same guy was in the fractal movie we watched
last week.  It intrigued me that he experienced distinct bands with unique
colors - like distilling one’s thought down to separate wavelengths.</p>

<p>2011-07-30 Held Aloft - The flow of the show</p>

<p>I saw your comment appear this morning, then it was gone
after I posted.  I did have a notice in my email.  Weird, maybe it will show up
later, or maybe it got removed somehow when I posted.</p>

<p>Several things have had me thinking about the early
migrations to America.  Specifically, bringing runes into the story.  I want to
understand the connection between early European cultures and the Americas - to
tie them together and find similarities in art and legend.  So Coda is now from
Central America and Loka/Moki is a member of a tribe from Europe.  An overall
theme in the story is successive waves of migration in boats - first the seal
hunters in kayaks, then the Vikings, then the Spanish, the Dutch and English,
then a modern day migration of ideas.</p>

<p>Here's the grand overview...</p>

<p>The story is told from the perspective of Michael (me) a
writer for a reality TV show about the Mayan rituals.</p>

<p>Yesterday it hit me that Michael will occasional have dreams
that he is in a hospital. I've wanted to tie in your stories without making it
too personal.  Michael represents both of us - people in decent relationships who
also like having multiple bands of intellect to traverse with. (People to talk
with online and dream about world's with.)  It gives us strength - and the
dream worlds we create sustain us and motivate us onward.</p>

<p>Michael and his friends are working on a television production
about the Maya New Year which is being filmed in the Caribbean.  It's sort of a
reality TV show where scientists are interviewed about time and space.  Michael's
wife is the show's producer.  She has enlisted him to play the winged man at
the end of the show - he's the equivalent to the New Year's Eve ball being
dropped in time square - except he will be hoisted aloft with wings over a
harbor filled with boats.  Boats gather every year in Tortola in the British
Virgin Islands to celebrate New Year.  They lash their decks together for a
grand party.</p>

<p>It all sounds wonderful, but Michael has no idea what he has
signed up for - &quot;I had no idea you'd draw blood from there!&quot; as he is
prepared to communicate with his ancestors.</p>

<p>The show’s producers are all his friends, in whom he sees
the attributes of a band of pirates. The first seven weeks of the show have
been a big success as the Maya New Year draws near, Dec 21, 2012.  Lots of
great insights from the scientists participating.  Some talk of early human migrations,
others mythology, all have very strong opinion and their disagreements are
caught on film - making for lively television.</p>

<p>Now, as the show reaches its crescendo, wings are attached
to Michael, but he is tired and worn.  Soon he will be soaring high over the
boats in the harbor, and on screens across the world.  Drifting in and out of
consciousness, his wife giving him a pep talk, he thinks about the stories of
time and the loves that have drifted throughout the narrative.</p>

<p>Now here's the deep reality underlying the story.  Michael is
actually already in the hospital.  The dreams he is having about the hospital,
are his reality.  The show, the winged man being hoisted aloft - these are his
dreams.  And now they merge.</p>

<p>2011-08-05 - Return from Kill Devil Hill</p>

<p>&#8220;The Wrights believed that flight by man was possible and
could be achieved through systematic scientific investigation and discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>In poetic thought we navigate and soar.  Here at Kitty Hawk,
cultures collide on the side of Kill Devil Hill.  Science and myth, love and
travel, past and present.</p>

<p>When Wilber and Orval had spare time in Kitty Hawk, they
would often imitate the birds. Arms outstretched, turning and banking.  It was
not behavior that that locals were accustomed to seeing.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Kitty Hawk to the moon in 66 years.&#8221;</p>

<p>11,000 years ago, the bird people met the cat people of the
forest.  Here on the mount of sand shaped like a pyramid.</p>

<p>When butterflies engage in flight, they nudge and dance,
then plummet downward.  It is the nudge and dance that is engrained in our
story telling mind.</p>

<p>If humans seeks to fly like birds, what do birds seek? 
Birds yearn to tell stories like a human.  Humans are motivated by the stories
we tell ourselves and others.  Stories are the soul of our creative action.</p>

<p>Our story telling fiber is emblazoned in our epigenetics. 
It is our rhythm.  The terse birdsong, the drawl of the cat, the abrupt bark of
the dog, the curving ohm of the chimp.</p>

<p>If the culture from the north followed and hunted the birds,
it was because the birds were the first to return after the meteor storms.</p>

<p>The extent of his traditional form struck me when opening
the North Carolina map.  There he stood, dancing, wings a flame.  Like so many
pieces of cultural messages, being fed in.  I had regurgitated and fed back the
images around me.</p>

<p>In so many American tribes, the winged man is central to
ritual.  He is alone, striving to transcend.  Now I have torn him down and
transcended his image.  I have killed and butchered the birdman, cast off his
flaming wings of tradition, and dropped the customs smoldering fragments into
the water below.</p>

<p>Now the charcoal air swirls around my face, from the vestige
torn asunder.  It was on the deck of a pirate ship in a miniature golf course
that I gained my footing – surrounded by the beauty of my cohesive family. 
Here I found my strength.  Here I, who never played miniature golf with a
family unit, could hold on to a solid story, a love, a solid memory.</p>

<p>From the dreaming winged man, comes the active man with
balls of fire and the ire of Black Beard.  Edward who sought total
decentralization.  Edward Beard referred to his crew as &#8220;the flying gang&#8221; for
he had merged the dream with the group – sons of North Carolina farmers who had
returned to the sea to seek out Spanish gold sunk off the coast of Florida.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>2011-08-06</p>

<p>I can literally feel the process of overlap and assimilation
occurring in my brain – live a magnetic curve coming from the left side of my
brain, over the top and onto the right side.  I feel the magnetic resistance
and attraction as this new worldview is laid down upon my existing view of my
friends, as they come to represent a family from my early childhood.  It’s a
literary device to tie the story together, but the pieces fit together well
enough that a common thread emerges.  The sensation is very much like the outer
curve of a spiral shell, not too tight at first – merely a loose bind where
thoughts and emotions coincide.</p>

<p>2011-08-07 Hypnosis</p>

<p>Hypnosis involves a transition from left to right
hemispheric dominance. Those who favor their left hemisphere are more
susceptible to hypnosis! So if your friend is better at exact calculations,
reciting facts and figures, and linear reasoning – they’re also more likely to
dance-like-a-chicken at the county fair.</p>

<p>2011-08-08 Disintegration and reuniting</p>

<p>Yes, it's all super funny - all great koans are a whack in
the side of the head.</p>

<p>I was careful not to hype hang gliding. The kids were
worried a year ago when I told them we'd someday take a spaceship into space,
so we've decided to stay mostly on earth. (Austen then figured out we could
create a protective bubble atmosphere, so we might be okay to go later.)</p>

<p>I realized when we were traveling that my character is going
to transcend the bird man state, literally set it on fire. It hit me when I
pulled out the North Carolina map on our way home, and there staring at me was
a picture of a dancing Cherokee bird man - on fire.  The cliche made me destroy
the image in my mind, made me reject every standard symbol, shred the wings for
a new uncharted set of symbols.</p>

<p>A man half-conscious is sent aloft in a para-sail in the
story (final part of the reality show after he's interviewed the science minded
people).  But the reality is that he is already dead. He's told his wife to
spread his ashes over Kitty Hawk.  Suddenly he realizes he is a million ashes
being caught up in the wind.  Even though he is dead, his dream mind, thinking
in reverse, has to find an explanation for what's happening (during part of the
7 day process described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead).</p>

<p>The explanation is that each ash is a microscopic wave sent
outward to millions of viewers - a coming together as the universe drifts
further apart. Black holes absorb very little, most material entering them
simply changes state and is accelerated outward - so the message is that death
changes the surface of thought for those left behind. I'm placing an emphasis
on surfaces since the Mandelbrot Set (BuddhaBrot) is a key part of the
awakening story.</p>

<p>(Sell the ashes.)</p>

<p>Hmm, so the ultimate dream beyond the ultimate dream is
complete disintegration and reuniting.</p>

<p>Tonight Abbey told me about a dream she had where two pirate
ships were racing - and they had to stop at a red light - like in the book Go
Dog Go.  Austen talked about flying dreams - so cool since I don't recall flying
in my dreams until high school. Kids grow up so fast these days. :D</p>

<p>Fayaz told me about how his friend would catch upward moving
funnels of air.</p>

<p>2011/08/12 - Torn Apart – Microwaved</p>

<p>Okay, I’ve been researching microwaves and health .  It’s a
very HEATED debate.</p>

<p>Here’s the study that links microwave oven and hair dryer
magnetic field (MF) exposure of pregnant mothers to asthma in their kids – 3
times the average!</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.wcpo.com/dpp/news/health/healthy_living/study-links-microwave-oven-exposure-to-asthma">http://www.wcpo.com/dpp/news/health/healthy_living/study-links-microwave-oven-exposure-to-asthma</a></p>

<p>I’ve been researching this since we talked.  I’ll be hanging
out with my two science buddies at the pool tonight, so I’m feeling a little
more educated now after reading up.  </p>

<p>The question I have for them is whether magnetic field (MF)
exposure alone is the issue, or if nutrient depletion and changes to molecular
structural (isomerism) is a factor.  Any heating of food is going to reduce the
nutrients – so RAW is the way to go when possible.</p>

<p>My buddies, Ron and Fayaz, might say tonight that people who
stand close to microwaves, and blow dry their hair, are doing something else
that contributes to asthma in their kids.</p>

<p>BTW, Meilani had terrible asthma.  Very sexy breathing in
bed, but I couldn’t help wonder if it was genetic.  In retrospect, she was
probably a formula-fed baby.</p>

<p>Hey, I wonder if the study factored in the use of heated infant
formula?  I’ll print the study and look at that more closely by the pool.</p>

<p>The women wore monitors that measured their MF exposure. 
I’d love to have one of those, we live by a power line and this morning when I
took my feet off the wall I heard my nasal passages (inner ear) click - which
NASA found is an indicator of microwave radiation level changes.</p>

<p>Here’s the best overview I found on microwaved food studies,
but unfortunately the research sited is old (not online) and largely refutable.</p>

<p><a
href="http://trusted.md/blog/vreni_gurd/2009/04/18/microwave_ovens_convenience_vs_nutrition_and_health#axzz1UqD6Lv4V">http://trusted.md/blog/vreni_gurd/2009/04/18/microwave_ovens_convenience_vs_nutrition_and_health#axzz1UqD6Lv4V</a></p>

<p>Conclusion – don’t turn down microwaved food and water, but
avoid it if you can.</p>

<p>PS: This science fair plant growing project with microwaved
plant water freaked me out initially - but no one has reproduced it, so I think
it’s probably a flawed experiment.  I'd like to try this at home if the kids
have to do a science fair project.</p>

<p>Shazbut!  This study alone is not clear evidence to condemn
microwaving food.</p>

<p>I think this study is misidentifying the core cause.  The
effect of increased magnetic fields is minor compared to the molecular alteration
of the food.  </p>

<p>&quot;Below is a science fair project. A young girl filtered
water and divided it into two parts. The first part she heated to boiling in a
pan on the stove, and the second part she heated to boiling in a microwave.
Then after cooling, she used them to water two identical plants to see if there
would be any difference in the growth between the plant using water boiled on
the stove, and the plant using water boiled in a microwave. She was thinking
that the structure or energy of the water may be compromised by microwaving. As
it turned out, even she was amazed at the difference.&quot;</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.snopes.com/science/microwave/plants.asp#exp1">http://www.snopes.com/science/microwave/plants.asp#exp1</a></p>

<p>My rebuttal: &#8220;The last photo in this article seems to
demonstrate the opposite of what is states. The broad leaf plant is limper when
watered with microwaved water. It would appear that plant fibers are weakened
by changes to structural &quot;isomerism&quot; caused microwave heating. The
tap water plant is more anemic - perhaps from impurities in the water.  Clearly
more science fair experiments are needed.</p>

<p>In 1989, Dr. Lita Lee noted in the December issue of the
British medical journal Lancet that microwaved milk or baby formula not only
depletes the vitamin content but converts certain amino acids (the constituents
of protein) into related substances that are biologically inactive. Some of
these altered amino acids are known poisons to both the nervous system and the
kidneys.</p>

<p>&quot;It's bad enough that many babies are not nursed,&quot;
Lee wrote, &quot;but now they are given fake milk (baby formula) made even more
toxic via microwaving.&quot; [Cited in Alexander, Gary. &quot;Throw It In The
Microwave&quot; in Chronogram, February 2001, p. 9]</p>

<p>Do adults think they’re immune because they’ve stopped
growing?  Wrong, our production of white blood cells has been found to decrease
when we eat microwaved food!</p>

<p>If it ain’t good enough for a baby, maybe we should all take
heed and use our conventional ovens whenever possible.  In the very least, boil
water and then submerge the item being heated in a container placed in the hot
water. </p>

<p>&#8220;The disruption of the water molecules is so intense that
they are literally torn apart and become structurally deformed. Chemists even
have a name for this phenomenon: structural &quot;isomerism.&quot;</p>

<p>Like a series of carbon atoms put the right way can be a
diamond, it can also just be ashes… That’s all.</p>

<p>2011-08-22 pre-inflationary particle</p>

<p>I think so. Last week astronomers detected evidence of the
previous universe that is in the process of being overwritten and assimilated
by the most recent big bang. I'd like to think inhabitants of the previous
universe were smart enough to figure out how to transcend via data into the current one.
I'd like to think the new universe adds aroma to freshly cooked thyme.</p>

And more recently
Possible vestiges of a universe previous to the Big Bang
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171127105935.htm

<p>David writes:</p>

<p>Before time started in our universe, we were a PIP
(pre-inflationary particle).  When time started, our universe suddenly inflated
like a bubble, expanding outward faster than the speed of light – gravity can
do that.</p>

<p>If we view the pre-inflationary particle as static, then
giant concentric rings are visible today in the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB). If our PIP was moving before it inflated, then the data shows a parity
(distortion) which might best be explained by our bubble colliding with another
universe.  String theory alone does not explain either the parity or the rings,
so one implication is that other universes may have pre-existed in the local
vicinity of where our PIP expanded.

Are the rings the residue of black holes from a prior aeon?

<p>The implication is that light outside the gravity of the

neutrino, rather than years. The big bang expansion occurred significantly
faster than the speed of light. Perhaps the properties of a photon change in
the absence of a strong gravity well.</p>
