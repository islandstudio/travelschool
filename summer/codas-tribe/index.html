<h1>Cave on the Forest's Edge</h1>

  <p>From the age of three, Moki (Low-KO-knee) has been left behind in the butterfly forest each spring as his tribe followed the migrations north. Each year, the running tribe returned, adorned him with feathers, and wished that someday he too would join them in their run.  But his &quot;crazy knees&quot; would seemingly always keep him land-locked.</p>
  <p>When not in the safety of the trees, he was eager to explore the limestone caves along the forest floor on the edges of the hill sides. Here, in the narrow crevasses, he was most adept, accustomed to pulling himself along, the strength of his arms grew and allowed him to scale and hold with one hand while painting with the other.  Creating magnificent murals deep under the earth, he illustrated the stories of the land far to the north as it was described to him by the other members of the running tribe.</p>

<p>While he was young, Moki was cared for by a young girl from the Jaguar Tribe. Her name was Coda.</p>

<p>To understand Coda, you had to understand what made her tribe unique. They were living here in the valley separated from the larger tribes. Their secluded farms preserved a tranquil peace. There were no big migrations through the valley, only birds and butterflies came with the seasons. Their cave art was distinctly different from the other tribes. As a cave artist, Moki extended this tradition, adding a twist of his own.</p>
<p>The following dialog between two spelunkers is taken almost verbadum from the following Slate article: http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/03/americas_ancient_cave_art.4.html</p>
<p>Outside and resting before the hike back to the truck, Simek said, &quot;Think about it. What was there none of in that cave?&quot; (cave art dating around 1160 at the Woodland/ Mississippian threshold.&quot;He suspected these particular caves were a holdover of some localized, regional Woodland culture, from before it was swept away or homogenized by the spread of the Death Cult.&quot;)<br>
</p>
<p>I had no answer. Hadn't there been everything in that cave?<br>
  </p>
<p>&quot;Out of more than three hundred images, there wasn't a single weapon anywhere,&quot; he said. &quot;We have here an early Mississippian art in which there are no images of violence, where the birds are pure birds, not linked to war—they're in flight. </p>
<p>Even the human figures are not obviously warriors.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>Also there had been women and sex in that cave. I thought about it. No women and sex in any of the other caves.<br>
