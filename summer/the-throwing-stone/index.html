<h1>The Throwing Stone</h1>

  <p>I pick up the stone, flip it over twice, and let it sink into my hand. My thumb moves across the stone's curved edge, cool and smooth, lost in reflection.</p>

  <p>Dr Lancroft had warned if we threw enough energy at the Bosan Higgs<!--using an excellerator the size of the earth-->, we'd initiate a <a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2014/09/will-higgs-boson-destroy-universe-cosmic-death-bubble/">true vacuum</a> - a bubble that would take us down an energy level, expanding outward at the speed of light, 
  <!-- like dropping suddenly from Gamma to Delta when losing consciousness and falling into a dream.  -->
  billions of lost souls, trillions of lost stories. All gone in an expanding wavelength collapse called quantum tunneling, an unfathomly strong shortcut into a lower energy state.
  <!--

  -->
  </p>

  <p>My index finger comes to the slightly raised button on the edge of the stone.  My thumb slips into the hole in the center of the stone.</p>

   <p>And what if we did just the opposite now, remove small amounts of energy, gradually decompress an infinitely small area, until we distort the surrounding particle field with an accumulated concentration of focus, spinning like a cork screw - could we twist the surrounding space into a smaller, wider plane using Baryon acoustic oscillations - allowing energy to move between beta and theta waves to send a message, ethed on the fabric of space-time for future wanderers to observe within their region of space - a message that would hopefully get us the hell out of here?</p>

  <p>My arm moves outward and back from my side as I prepare to skip the stone wide, over the lapping mirror-like waves.</p>

  <p>In late 2013, Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered a handwritten manuscript by Einstein which was overlooked by other scientists. The research paper was titled "Zum kosmologischen Problem" (About the Cosmological Problem). Einstein proposed a revision of his model, still with a cosmological constant, but now the constant was responsible for the creation of new matter as the universe expanded. Thus, the average density of the system never changed. He stated in the paper, "In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time." And: "If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="einstein" style="white-space: nowrap;">Wikipedia on Einstein</a></p>

  <p>This is consistent with today's modern understanding of dark energy. 
  Instead of hordes of invisible particles, “dark matter is an interplay between ordinary matter and dark energy,” Verlinde said.</p>

<p>There on the shore, my finger tight around the stone's edge, button pressed, ready to unleash. 
"Everyone has their own kind of crazy" I think to myself. The lake before me is mercury, the stone a mineral organic framework perfect for triggering a chain reaction of epic proportions.
</p>

<p>
  Then, just before I push the button and let the stone glide out over the silvery lake, a voice from behind me says "wait" and I release a deep breath of relief as Lucendia's comforting hand rubs across my sore shoulder. 

  "We have all the time. All the time in the world." she says softly, holding up a similar version of the stone I was about to throw.
</p>
<p>
"All the time in the world." I say, returning her smile. I drop the Memory Stone into her other hand and slump into her embracing arms.
</p>

    This is the way the universe ends, not with a bang, but a GEODE - Stars collapse into either singularities or slightly larger Generic Objects of Dark Energy (GEODEs). These appear as black holes from the outside but they contain Dark Energy instead of a singularity.  "GEODEs grow together with the universe during the time leading up to their collisions. When the collisions occur, the resulting GEODE masses become four to eight times larger."

  "In the 1960s, Hawking and the Oxford University physicist Roger Penrose proved that when space-time bends steeply enough, such as inside a black hole or perhaps during the Big Bang, it inevitably collapses, curving infinitely steeply toward a singularity, where Einstein’s equations break down and a new, quantum theory of gravity is needed. The Penrose-Hawking “singularity theorems” meant there was no way for space-time to begin smoothly, undramatically at a point."

Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) observations of Hawkins Points in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) suggest that the universe expansion could be a cyclical process with 98% confidence. (Sir Roger Penrose, Aug 2018) - <a href="https://youtu.be/FVDJJVoTx7s?t=462">YouTube</a>
</p>

Debatable, but exciting none-the-less, especially since photons (electromagnetic energy) can, in theory, make the jump between expanding instances of the universe. Conformal geometry matches the beginning of one Aeon (pronounces Eon) to the start of the next.  The beginning and the ending of the phases are theorized as being close to equivalent as being void of matter (and therefore time), however magnetic patterns from large black holes in the previous instance of the universe may carry forward.<br><br>


As each instance of the universe expands to the point of eliminating matter (mass), physics looses track of scale. Therefore the big universe and small (quantum scale) become equivalent. The entire universe after it has expanded to practically nothing, is physically equivalent to the origin of the big bang - since there is no mater present to have a scale. Evidence suggests that the origin of each big bang is not a singularity at the start. Details from the previous universe instance may therefore carry forward. Concentric sets of low variance circles reside in the cosmic microwave background radiation.<br><br>

Physicist Paul Todd pondered if magnetic fields could get through from one Aeon to another.  Penrose said yes, magnetic fields are photons, therefore mass-less and would not even respect the scale of the early universe. A telescope at the South Pole recently found primordial B modes, which could be from these primordial magnetic fields.<br><br>

Sir Roger Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) states that Dark matter (which he refers to as Aerobons, after the Greek god Erebus) decays as the universe expands. The Emergent Gravity theory by Erik Verlinde (2016) suggests that dark matter is a gravitational distortion effect (rather than a particle itself). As matter expands outward, the gravitational effect of dark matter dissipates. Hence, matter moving away from matter eventually eliminates dark matter. As matter forms increasingly massive black holes, we should expect a large counter-point of dark matter. Penrose points out that the plank map of the universe has such a void patch forming. Could be the open space from which the next instance of the universe is already expanding?<br><br>

<p>In defense of dark matter: "Particle dark matter is essential to obtain the correct predictions for the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. That’s a remarkable achievement, and no alternative for dark matter can be taken seriously so long as it cannot do at least as well. Unfortunately, Verlinde’s emergent gravity model does not allow the necessary analysis – at least not yet. In summary, particle dark matter is doing fine, and emergent gravity still has a long road ahead to outcompete it." <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/02/28/is-dark-matter-about-to-be-killed-by-emergent-gravity/#368a7f355359">Source</a></p>

<h3>Lancroft's Notes</h3>

<p>I've assembled a panel of experts<!-- in my head-->. Each one provides the input of a philosophy whose opinion matters. I say, "how would so-and-so approach this."  Subsequently, I'm pround to say I don't have any opinions that are truly my own. I selectively make choices by counterbalancing the stance of one expert with the view point of another. You may be surprised to hear that such a seemingly wishy-washy stance is the basis of someone who has achieved my level of accomplishment. But it is truely the base from which I've drawn most direction. The art is knowing which expert to turn to when. 
Some of the paths I follow are hereditary, others are learned.  Through the process I create the illusion of self and self determination. Or should I say, we create the illusion.</p>

<p>Yay, in Maine when the driver says "Hold My Beer" you know there's gonna be some quantum tunneling involved. Finn's uncle's voice pulled him back from the dream within a dream. The snow falling around the pickup collected at the corners of the window where the wipers had not tread. Trickles of melt moved through the accumulating snow, following paths of old.</p>

  Thomas Hertog works at the Catholic University of Leuven, but claims our universe never had a singular moment of creation.<br>

  <p>At the edge of our universe, as the stability wanes, perhaps a "controlled burst" could etch a message in the background radiation to share with the next universe - a favorite symphony, a poem or some other daydream. Finn thought to himself as he drifted off again.</p>

    Is the bubble of vacuum decay keeping you up at night, or rocking you to sleep?

    "Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid, so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time, could exist in two states," explained Gian Giudice, a theoretical physicist at the CERN lab, where the Higgs boson was discovered. (TED talk in October 2013)</p>

    <p>
    Right now the Higgs field is in a minimum potential energy state — like a valley in a field of hills and valleys. The huge amount of energy required to change into another state is like chugging up a hill. If the Higgs field makes it over that energy hill, some physicists think the destruction of the universe is waiting on the other side.
    </p>

    <p>
    But an unlucky quantum fluctuation, or a change in energy, could trigger a process called "quantum tunneling." Instead of having to climb the energy hill, quantum tunneling would make it possible for the Higgs field to "tunnel" through the hill into the next, even lower-energy valley. This quantum fluctuation will happen somewhere out in the empty vacuum of space between galaxies, and will create a "bubble," Lykken said.</p>

    <p>
    Here's how Hawking describes this Higgs doomsday scenario: "The Higgs potential has the worrisome feature that it might become metastable at energies above 100 [billion] gigaelectronvolts (GeV). This could mean that the universe could undergo catastrophic vacuum decay, with a bubble of the true vacuum expanding at the speed of light. This could happen at any time and we wouldn't see it coming."

  <p><!--Would Hawking have made it through the peer review process with his assertion that a particle accelerator the size of the earth could wipe out the universe? -->The consensus is that the Higgs particle will collapse in about a Googol years - when all the particles in our universe are so spread out that it's practically a true vacuum before the bubble bursts.</p>

  
  <p>A feedback-effect between particles dials the mass of the Higgs particle up and down. Give it a blast and the elasticity of the surrounding particles will likely retain equilibrium around the blast point. Scale-symmetry replaces bubbles with balance.</p>

<div class="visible">
<p>Stephen Hawking's previous 'no boundary theory' predicted that if you go back in time to the beginning of the universe, the universe shrinks and closes off like a sphere, but this new theory represents a step away from the earlier work. "Now we're saying that there is a boundary in our past," said Hertog.</p>

<p>Hertog and Hawking used their new theory to derive more reliable predictions about the global structure of the universe. They predicted the universe that emerges from eternal inflation on the past boundary is finite and far simpler than the infinite fractal structure predicted by the old theory of eternal inflation.</p>

<p>Their results, if confirmed by further work, would have far-reaching implications for the multiverse paradigm. "We are not down to a single, unique universe, but our findings imply a significant reduction of the multiverse, to a much smaller range of possible universes," said Hawking.</p>

<p>This makes the theory more predictive and testable.</p>

<p>Hertog now plans to study the implications of the new theory on smaller scales that are within reach of our space telescopes. He believes that primordial gravitational waves -- ripples in spacetime -- generated at the exit from eternal inflation constitute the most promising "smoking gun" to test the model. The expansion of our universe since the beginning means such gravitational waves would have very long wavelengths, outside the range of the current LIGO detectors. But they might be heard by the planned European space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA, or seen in future experiments measuring the cosmic microwave background.</p>

 <p>Wait, microwave background? That's photons, I thought we were talking about gravity.</p>

 <p>In 2014, scientists thought they discovered faint signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation that looked like evidence of gravitational waves created in the very early universe.  But it turned out to be dust in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

<p>If you're going to disarm quantum physics, you'll need an ethereal, nonlocal wave function that can travel unimpeded on both sides of any wall.</p>

<p>"That sounds like gravity," I replied.</p>

<p>"A theory of local interactions between a particle and its pilot wave like de Broglie’s would need to get a whole lot weirder in the jump from one particle to two to account for nonlocal entanglement." - <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/famous-experiment-dooms-pilot-wave-alternative-to-quantum-weirdness-20181011/">source</a></p>

<p>But what if all particles are already entangled?</p>

<p>"In de Broglie-Bohm theory, there’s an abstract wave function that extends through space — an entity that’s just as mysterious in this theoretical framework as it is in the Copenhagen interpretation... The experimental predictions are identical to quantum physics."</p><!-- same article linked above -->


<p>In the debate over Copenhagen versus de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory: "in Copenhagen, there is no strange inversion of time precisely because we have no right to say anything about the photon’s past,” he wrote in an email. “In de Broglie-Bohm there is a reality independent of our knowledge, but there is no problem as there is no inversion — there is a unique causal (forward in time) description of everything." - <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/closed-loophole-confirms-the-unreality-of-the-quantum-world-20180725/">source</a></p>

<p>de Broglie's wave has a macroscopic analogy: the Faraday wave. "The wavefunction itself, and not the particles, determines the dynamical evolution of the system.... Nonlocality manifests as the fact that the velocity and acceleration of one particle depends on the instantaneous positions of all other particles." <!-- wikipedia --></p>

Dark Matter is one dimensional, hiding less than a hair's breadth away.

<p>Charlie Chaplin remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his theory of relativity. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food. At the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory.</p>
