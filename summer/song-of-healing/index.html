Oh goody! I'm going to wait until I'm in my most relaxed sleepy-time mode to listen.

Wow, sounds like a professional studio. I'm listening again and drifting off to dream land. Such a sweet melody. coo.

Actually, one dose was enough. I'm a different person this morning - if 3:20 am is morning yet. 

My favorite parts were the low notes. I woke up wanting to talk about the difficult things you underwent when you were young. Someday I want to talk, not email, about our earliest feelings and fears.

You know, I did that with Jenifer. It's probably the main reason we stayed just friends. I'm touching on the sexual healing I turned to you for, the unwinding a part of my psyche, the part that tends to isolate me. It's a complex and wonderful thing, being a neanderthal.

One of the chapters, in the snippets of stories I've written over the last few years, is about the 5 year old boy who went streaking in the corn fields. I haven't expanded the story emotionally like I could. The four boys run to the edge of the fields to catch a glimpse of the girl of their dreams. She stands in her window, in a white farm house with white curtains blowing around her, in her white dress, with the her back to them, and her long dark hair moving over her olive skin. But she's actually not there when the boys go to look for her, they only imagine her, from the edge of the field. Standing naked, hidden by the tall field of corn, blowing in the wind. It's actually a bit humorous, there's a cluelessness wrapped around their expectations - shaped by the culture and media and the box of porn magazines stored by their father for them in the basement. Those boys taught me the birds and bees, to be an observer running through the corn.

So what I don't know is how your father fits in to your own story. I don't know if he was bad to you (probably not so bad because I see that you love him profoundly), I don't know the events that drove your mother away, I don't know a lot. And I've either never really asked, or I've never wanted to put pressure on you to turn over stones from the past.

I do know that there's a another 5 year old girl who the girl in the white farm house is a composite of. She lived behind me in my suburban white home in Ottawa Illinois, separated from me by a tall fence. We didn't know each other, and we only looked at each other a few times through the fence, but she was beautiful too. Long flowing brown hair. I can remember looking into her eyes, through the separation.  Some nights I would hear her father making a whistle call to bring her home for dinner. It was the loudest whistle you'll ever hear, his two fingers placed inside his mouth to shape the tone, man it was loud.

So before I listened I had this thought earlier in the day that the melody would be a bit like a voodoo doll, but in a good way, having come from Haiti. I had assumed the healing would be solely about loss, but I think it is more a song of strength. Do you agree? It's about the strength to do things maybe you didn't know you needed more strength to do. For me, I'm overcoming the experiences that locked a part of my personality in the mind of a five year old. That's not a bad thing, having a perpetually young world view, but I also want to round out my personality, to be more social and less focused on my work.

Okay, now I'm going to listen to the song a second time. This is going to take quite a while to memorize, but I'm up to the challenge and I have my whole life ahead of me to do so. It's beautiful, but it's like a very strong potion. I need to calm down a bit before I take another sip. But i's still early, so here we go.
