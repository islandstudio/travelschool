			<h1>Captcha, You're It!</h1>

The pride in his work shows in his eyes. He turns a piece of metal in his hand and sets in down in an old briefcase.

"No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure."<br><br>

<h2>Chapter 4 - The Outer Banks</h2>

Our family traveled to Kitty Hawk in 1973, walking up the side of Kill Devil Hill.  The grass was lush and green.  As a young four year old boy, my mind was alight with images of flight and invention.<br><br>

Our tour guide waved his arms like a bird, "In Wilbur and Orville's spare time, they'd flap around like birds, trying to better understand how they used their wings to bank and turn in the wind. It wasn't something the locals weren't accustomed to seeing grown men do, especially in formal wool suits on hot days."

Arms outstretched, turning and tilting like a Hopi Indian dancer, I ran down and across the sloping hill from the monument.  A killdeer flew up in front of me, squawking madly. I tumble and land on my back looking upward.<br><br>

I watch it fly higher, twisting and turning in waves and eddies.  Jumping up, I tumble down the grass and land on my feet this time, in a squat. Wilbur and Orville were preparing their legs for the jolts and twists of first flight back in 1903.<br><br>

I had yet to start Kindergarden on that first trip to Kitty Hawk.  It was the year before my mother left my father.  We'd come to the Outer Banks with our small blue tent camper hiched to the Pontiac.<br><br>
