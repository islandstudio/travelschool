<h1>Who Was Wu?</h1>


<p>I don't want to spoil this for you dear audiene, but I think this in the same w..."</p>

<p>His voice trailed off</p>

<p>Word? Work? Wo? Who Was Wu?</p>

<p>I thought about it a bit, trying to figure out what could fit in to the rest of the story.  Wound?  The buried man had the same wound as my father had, coming down the mountain.  Not in the same place, but from the same weapon.  A broad edged spear with two adjacent edges.  Oddly, the curve of the scars came together near the center, like a pair of butterfly wings.  And these had the look of scars or burns, so this wasn't a fatal wound.</p>

<p>2012/03 - Down, down, down into the murky substrate</p>

<p>Why then climb? Where would thou fly but not but to lose
time? We have all flown in our distant past. From flying you land on the
bridge, staring upward, trying to figure out how to re-merge with the twirling
tree of DNA that rises above you. Perplexed. Only in brief instances could
you fly, reaching upward in the dream smoke. And time would stop, jerk and
kick you backwards. Unfulfilled. Fleeting, start now from the secure position
of your foot on the bridge, and descend downward. </p>

<p>Drop into the shadows below the bridge, down into the muck.
Down, down, down. For here in the murky substrate your decedents lie as of yet
unborn. Speak with them. Feel their pains and emotions. See them strive to
rise above, back to a time when fungus ruled the earth. Here in the curving
banks of the river, into all life. </p>

<p>You have reached the shore of the river, where the boats
glide past. You have found your final stage, and passed into your children's,
children's children. A message bond in the changing bonds that surround the
DNA, a message bound in a rhythm and a rhyme. A message born in time, of time,
through time. Let the silt sift through your fingers, here on the shore, here
covered in mud, making love to the swirls of life and earth.</p>

<p>You are dust borne in water and you have merged. In each
fish eye see the soul of a child not yet fully formed, wondering. That this
fish is somehow my future, our future.</p>

<p>There, you make contact, with the intellect that ponders
your omnipotence and wonders why you have always been there in their reference
on time. You move so slow in their reference frame, the reference frame of
minutia, the very small. Only when they slow down do they hear you, only in
their dreams.</p>

<p>2012-01 DNA - filter for the internal abyss - the ancestors</p>

<p>First and foremost, you have to reject the clouded logic
of string theory and general relativity.</p>

<p>Look at the solid science behind fractals and the infinite
depth and endless boundaries that all magnetic energy exhibits.</p>

<p>Next, ponder that each time we re-think a memory we re-record
in our minds. Why? Why is there no permanent storage?</p>

<p>Here's what's happening. Sound and vision enter the matter
you are composed of. On their own accord, they would typically travel deep
into the microcosms of your DNA, never to be heard from again - lost in the
endless series of fractals with infinite depth that all magnetic energy
exhibits.</p>

<p>But your DNA, in each nerve cell, has evolved to capture and
reinforce some waves. It plays a little trick with its rolls and folds,
allowing your matter to retain and replay select vibrations of sound and
vision, while most of it trails away on an inward journey into you like a
1950's TV show beamed out in space.  The more you replay, the more you retain
the experience at the forefront of your internal abyss.</p>

<p>But what of the sounds and impressions that have been
repeated often enough to etch permanent patterns and become instinct? In what
ways do we pass these vibrations on between generation in our epigenetics, the
tiny structures that surround our DNA? A rat trained to run a maze will have
children with a natural affinity for running mazes. Significant changes are
being transferred between generations, side-stepping Darwinian evolution.</p>

<p>The actions of our teen years, when we are still growing,
have the most profound epigenetic effect on the future behavior and skills of
our children. We pass forward new ways to observe a changing environment -
void of conscious thought, but deeply steeped in instinctive reactions and
desires.</p>

<p>And what of the inner universe we inherit from our
parents? How do we navigate the inner folds to really get at what the hell our
parents were thinking when they got hitched!</p>

<p>We throw a memory into consciousness (RAM), then quickly
save it back to disk &#8220;mostly&#8221; unchanged. However, the longer wavelengths of
deep sleep traverse our storage areas without altering the data. How is this
possible? How do long wavelength retrieve so much information, creates a near
perfect copy of reality in a dream, than fade into oblivion with little or no
recollection later, beyond their shaping of the subconscious? Something to
sleep on.</p>

<p>The answer is in how quantum donuts trap and release photons
when the frequency changes. </p>

<p>&#8220;Intuitively, nucleosome remodelling should antagonize the
maintenance of stable structures. However, upon closer inspection it becomes
evident that nucleosome remodelling is intimately involved in the assembly of
stable chromatin structures that correspond to functional states. Remodellers
may even contribute structural information themselves.&#8221;</p>

beyond consciousness that makes decisions without our awareness? Clearly this

<p>&#8220;Terrence Sejnowski, a computational neuroscientist at the
Salk Institute, extols the discovery that the conscious, deliberative mind is
not the author of important decisions such as what work people do and who they
marry. Instead, he writes, &quot;an ancient brain system called the basal
ganglia, brain circuits that consciousness cannot access,&quot; pull the
strings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Running on the neurochemical dopamine, they predict how
rewarding a choice will be - if I pick this apartment, how happy will I be? -
&quot;evaluate the current state of the entire cortex and inform the brain
about the best course of action,&quot; explains Sejnowski. Only later do people
construct an explanation of their choices, he said in an interview, convincing
themselves incorrectly that volition and logic were responsible.&#8221;</p>

<p>a passage close to A.M. Monius's heart: The seeker of pure
knowledge is &quot;delighted at last to be seeing what is Real and watching
what is True, and so feeds on all this and feels wonderful.... And when one has
seen all things as they really are and feasted upon them, one sinks back inside
heaven and goes home.&quot;</p>

<p>The last two-thirds of &quot;Coming to Understanding&quot;
are devoted to a discussion of categories similar to Aristotle's, such as the
Universal, the Particular, the Spatio-temporal, and the Cognizable. A.M. Monius
believes that these categories demarcate the fundamental types of Being and—in
light of their interrelations—suggest the purpose of contingent being.</p>

<p>Listening sessions at the beach. My mother and the letters
my father sent her. The listening session of our local high school
redistricting. Who are we? I know that I am increasingly looking at my own
programming.</p>

<p>You were actually somewhere totally elsewhere, but you were
creating a dream that explained it. The pulling from the breast, the nipping
tentacles of jelly fish. Each time, the waves of memory lapsing around an
untouched patch of sand. The calmness at the center of your being, your
bearings, your satori.</p>

<p>I held Terri in my arms in the water off Saint Simons. It
was the one moment where I could turn and go another way. But the internal
conflict became about letting my mother be the deciding factor. The bodies of
other women were overshadowed by a twisting of the logic back to a mother-son
separation struggle. Tentacles brushed against my legs, stinging slightly.

<p>2012-03 Giant Bonsai - New Dawn</p>

<p>2012/3/22</p>

<p>K&#333;an: a story or dialogue, the meaning of which cannot
be understood by rational thinking but may be accessible through intuition or
lateral thinking. (I like to talk in riddles because you'll wake with an answer
that will be your own.)</p>

<p>We have a tree at our school we call the giant bonsai. It's
roots are bundled by a wall. Each year more of the outer branches die.</p>

<p>We have wondered why the roots don't grow under the wall.
But water pulled up from the tree roots is like pulling string. The more the
roots have to zig and zag, the less water can be pulled up. So even a short distance
becomes a burden.</p>

<p>On one side of the wall, the roots want more opportunity. On
the other side, the school sought a level playing area. We are now looking for
ways to give the roots more opportunity.</p>

<p>6-7 at Coan. 8-9 at King. Both public. </p>

<p>A bus goes one way in the morning, full. The same bus
returns the other way, also full, also in the morning. A new dawn.</p>

<p><span>Visualize the water being pulled
up the tree roots like pulling string.&nbsp; The more the roots zig-and-zag,
the less water can be pulled up.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>That's why tree branches form
smooth lines without sudden right angles. &nbsp;Roots are the same, so bending
to go under the wall won't give the tree the upward flow it needs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Each year the tree has fewer
leaves at the tips of the branches.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The tree saves the school a lot
of money on cooling bills by providing shade on the south side of the
school.&nbsp; Fuller branches will save even more.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Glenwood Park has a watering
timer that checks the weather report to determine when not to water, that's
what we need.</span></p>

<p><span>- Create a recessed area where
water can soak in about 12' to 16' east of large tree.</span></p>

<p><span>- Surround trees and plants with
drip irrigation on a timer from large water barrel.</span></p>

<p><span>- Add a decorative, low wooden

Loren,<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention...I asked Laura if it would be ok if I tried to get a tree
service on site to assess the health/trimming needs of our trees. She is
supportive and has forwarded the request to Cherie. I think ArborGuard will at
least look at them for free and we can weigh the true costs of care/no
care.&nbsp; I'm concerned that they not only need care to prevent further
deterioration, but also trimming for safety reasons.<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
I'll let you know what transpires... I know money is so hard to come by but,
beyond safety issues, the cost of not doing preventive care is dead tress that
cost thousands to remove.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

Hi, sorry, got very busy! I don't know for sure but was told that it's a<br>
pecan... Watering every day is not a good idea. Short, frequent watering<br>
promotes shallow roots and would not give the tree much water. I'm not a<br>
tree expert but I do know that watering with a soaker hose, looped away from<br>
trunk and going around and out to the &quot;drip line&quot; (outermost branches
where<br>
water would drip off) is probably the best way to do it. I defer to Trees<br>
Atlanta for advice!<br>
<br>
As far as a timer is concerned, I'm not sure that a timer alone can be<br>
connected to the cistern. I think it's a little more plumbing than that. You<br>
can contact Ellie Cantkier<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><a

&gt; Hello!<br>
&gt; Thank you for the link. Someone has to speak for the trees and, with<br>
&gt; The Lorax being featured everywhere, this is a great opportunity to<br>
&gt; get everyone thinking about caring for them.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; That said, however,I have been unable to take on more than the second<br>
&gt; grade garden. I would love to see the trees thickly mulched all over<br>
&gt; the property but, more immediately, assessed for their health and<br>
&gt; safety. The cistern would be a great way to water them but would<br>
&gt; probably need to be on a timer so that they aren't over-watered. I am<br>
&gt; not sure that the tree within the wall is strong enough to save but I<br>
don't know...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As far as a tree for the church parking lot is concerned, I defer to<br>
&gt; the experts at Trees Atlanta--they have been planting them in exactly<br>
&gt; those kinds of spaces for years and probably have the perfect suggestion.<br>

<!--
	In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree.

<p>We were worn, like a ragged sandals after a long season following the Greatful Dead.  Winding home after a busy Friday evening at the restaurant, I was very much looking forward to curling up with a good book to lull my mind to sleep. Steven arrived home shortly after I did.  He parked his jeep in the back. After hugging him I reached around to grab a bite from the big bag of zucinni bread we'd traded with the deli next door for tomorrow's breakfast.</p>

<p>Steven and I had been dating off and on for most of the previous five years.  He was both a mentor, an employer and a security blanket.  He'd taken over the pizzeria shortly after his father died, rescuing it from oblivion, while I rescued him from the loss of his dad. We were good for eachother, but not bound at the hip.</p>

<p>There's one book in particular I'd barely been able to put down, The Artisan. Funny thing though, I usually fall asleep after only a few pages.</p>

<p>I flip forward to where I left off.</p>

<p>Before long I'm yawning, I'm already drifting. But that's why I came here, for the dreams that soon come.</p>

<p>I arrive at work Saturday afternoon, stash my old black sneakers in the cubby. A bookmark falls out of a paper bag holding a manuscript that my friend Jen gave me two days prior. The black lines form a skull pattern on a tan piece of parchment. I slide it into my back pocket, I'm moving quickly to get to work.</p>


<p>Another busy night.  The tips are good, so I don't mind, at least until the winter is gone.  Then I need to get myself organized, turn over a new leaf.</p>
