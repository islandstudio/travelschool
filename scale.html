The story always ends with your death.
It's just a question of how you get from here to there.<br><br>

Every moment is a meditation.<br><br>

Endclave is a choose-your-own-path game/movie/novel title, with the tag line: "The story always ends with your death. It's just a question of how you get from here to there."  

The title combines Endgame, with Enclave, with cave, with the notion of cutting off yourself from your previous self at the end of each journey. In other words, you don't have to let your previous experiences define your current experience. In the end you can completely transform if you successfully "clave" from your prior path - but you'd always want some form of a touchstone to connect your selves.

	"<i>What I like most about the Island Studio framework is the ease with which you can change the size and scale of your modeling environment. One second you are at the scale of an elementary particle.  Then wam, molecular physics experiences pop up around you that you can enter. 
		 
	The next second and you are exploring cellular biology, 
	creating the base components of tools and building materials. 

	You're learning engineering, geology, sociology and finance first hand.  
	The game experience goes through every science discipline  
	during the process of designing bots and power grids. 
	Then you discover, it's not just a game, the objects the top-level players are creating - they're real.</i>" -&nbsp;Austen&nbsp;Helix

		<b>Preparing for Departure</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	You are scheduled to arrive with your family at 6:30 pm.  Each arrival is staggered by 30 minutes to check temperatures and swab for viruses.  Please have a good night's rest. We'll have initial test results in the morning, followed by a four days of crafting and  sharing stories in the hotel before we embark on the boat to the studio.

	<p>Mitch Lancroft</p>

	<p>Mitch's son Austen's popular Real-World<sup style="font-size:10px">tm</sup> video game Moon Dog was developed using <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/740250/Neos_VR/">NeosVR</a>.
	<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUBaZQNn3UY -->

	Before it was removed, the Moon Dog profile read: "<i>You and your dog are among the members of a covert group, outmaneuvering entrenched monopolies, forming alliances with other independents, and using net-positive systems to power your bots, with surplus energy sold to neighboring microgrids.</i>"
	</p>

	<p>
	His sister Laura followed his success two years later with the release of the Cat Star mod. She extended the Moon Dog base with her own tales of space and exploration, astronomy and astrophysics.
	Both apps became a gateway to a whole other level of competition. Not just planning and design, but actual implementation. 
	Players became owners of bots, hired surfers, the whole 9&nbsp;yards.</p>

	<!-- Abbey says Transit Jewels are a little like a fireboy and watergirl map -->

	<p>That's why Cat Star and Moon Dog were shut down - too much of a threat. Everything was decentralized. 
		There was no mechanism for control.  But that's how the most successful players liked it, the open and organic nature of their code allowed it to morph, survive and thrive.

	12,800 years ago the interglacial period ended when asteroid explosions over Greenland released ice bound arctic lakes. The heat of the explosion caused nano diamond carbon dust to encircle the earth, which blocked the sun and resulted in a massive die off.  8,000 years ago the warming trend returned as human farming and herding began, exceeding the carbon absorption of limestone exposed by Himalayan uplift. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191025110314.htm">impact trigger</a>

	Using electrodes coated with carbon nanotubes, MIT developed a low energy process that "captures carbon dioxide from any concentration, including 400 parts per million, and allows its release into any carrier stream, including 100 percent CO2."

	I wanted to create a vehicle for all the great science articles that the internet makes so immediately accessible.  A framework from which the interested reader could dig deeper into something recently discovered.
	</p>
	<p>
	The other goal has been to give the written medium a visual edge that would allow it to compete with the enticements of online video, without departing from the contemplative nature of reading.  Allowing for both short attention spans, and expansions into greater depth without leaving the comfortable shell of each narrative. There's a path for the reader who want to only spend 10 minutes within the work, and another for individuals who will return often and build upon the story's connected resources.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each chapter is a meditation, an unrushed, prolonged thought grounded in each author's experiences. Taking concepts from the present, future and past, then blending in nuance and textures to create a new image.  I'll mull over something for a long time, like did fertility issues lead to the demise of neanderthal, and what was it like to observe this shift from the perspective of a disappearing race, and what of the few women who could bear female children with this dying race of men?

Here are a few authors that jump off my list of books read: Elmer Kelton, Rick Bragg, Smokey Yunick (his wife may have transcribed his recorded stories), and Bonnie Jo Campbell." - Grandpa Larry
