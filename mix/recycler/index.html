    <h2>Surma, man or superman</h2>

    <p style="line-height:14pt"><b>Jeffrey E. Surma</b> is leading the field in the area of high-level radioactive waste vitrification, electrochemical and plasma processing of waste.</p>

      <p style="font-size:.8em">[Excerpts from <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_trashblaster/all/">Wired Magazine Article</a>]</p>

      <p>Surma drives a Mercury Mariner, replaces tasseled loafers with work boots, yellow work hat.</p>

      <p>He has a runner’s physique and a shock of white hair. Wears wraparound sunglasses.</p>

      <p>Surma Graduated from Montana State University in 1985.</p>

      <p>"Hanford Nuclear Reservation, just down the road. Beginning with the Manhattan Project, the US government cooked most of the plutonium for America’s nuclear weapons arsenal at Hanford.  Nine nuclear reactors."</p>

      <p>"Those especially nasty substances, of course, were Surma’s specialty."</p>

      <h2>Dan Cohn</h2>

      <p>Dan made that fateful call from MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center to "Pacific Northwest, asking if anyone at the lab was doing plasma research, and he was connected with Surma."</p>

      <h2>Charles Titus</h2>

      <p>Charles, a retired engineer from GE, died in 2007, the loss tremendous, but the legend lives on.  "an expert in high-voltage engineering and had become convinced that metal torches, which tend to get damaged by the very heat they deliver, were the wrong technology. It would be better to create plasma with an electric arc strung between two graphite electrodes."</p>

      <p>"Titus, the electricity guru, said he could rig the AC/DC combo."  Direct current to the plasma arch, and alternating current to the plasma soup.</p>

      <p>In 1994, in a dimly lit room with mahogany walls at Manhattan’s Chemists’ Club, they presented the melter idea to the frozen-dinner guy.</p>

      <h2>All for One, One for All</h2>

      <p>They became the PEM Brothers - The Three Musketeers of plasma energy generation.</p>

      <p>35,000 tons of trash arrive weekly from Seattle by train and from Portland by truck.</p>

      <p>"On the southwest side of the landfill, bus-sized containers of gas connect to ribbons of piping, which run into a building that looks like an airplane hangar with a loading dock."</p>

      <h2>Plasma Enhanced Melter - Four stages, and a fourth state of matter</h2>
      <p>
      Stage 1. Trash is shredded and carried upward on a conveyer belt</p>
      <p>Stage 2. Furnace - a 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit furnace mixes with oxygen and steam - Syngas produced - 80% of waste vaporized.</p>
      <p>Stage 3. Plasma Arc (S4 the fourth state of matter) - this second vessel is "roughly the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Two electrodes aimed toward the middle of the vessel create an electric arc that, at 18,000 degrees, is almost as hot as lightning... isn’t incineration—this is emission-free molecular deconstruction"</p>
      <p>Stage 4. Molten Glass - "The small amount of waste material that survives falls to the bottom of the chamber, where it’s trapped in molten glass that later hardens into inert blocks."</p>
