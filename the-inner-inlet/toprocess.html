<div class="lyrics">
  <p>Score: One Tin Soldier (a slow, meandering version)</p>
<p>Listen, children, to a story</p>
<p>That was written long ago,</p>
<p>'bout a kingdom on a mountain</p>
<p>And the valley-folk below.</p>
</div>


<p>From the radio, &#8220;After 2,000 years buried within a
cave in the Holy Land, the portrait was found on a lead booklet, slightly
smaller than a credit card, which lay undiscovered in a cave in a remote
village in Jordan overlooking the Sea of Galilee.&#8221; <a

Warren, Mail Online, April 3, 2011</a></p>


<div class="lyrics">
<p>On the mountain was a treasure</p>

<p>Buried deep beneath the stone,</p>

<p>And the valley-people swore</p>

<p>They'd have it for their very own.</p>
</div>

<p>"According to sources in <span class=SpellE>Saham</span>,
they were discovered five years ago after a flash flood scoured away the dusty
mountain soil to reveal what looked like a large capstone. The water
exposed two nooks inside the cave, containing the booklets, metal plates and
scrolls."</p>


<div class="lyrics">
<p>Go ahead and hate your neighbor,</p>

<p>Go ahead and cheat a friend.</p>

<p>Do it in the name of Heaven,</p>

<p>You can justify it in the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="lyrics">
  <p>There won't be any trumpets blowing</p>

<p>Come the <span class=SpellE>judgement</span> day,</p>

<p><span class=GramE>On the bloody morning after....</span></p>

<p>One tin soldier rides away.</p>
</div>



<div class="lyrics">
<p>So the people of the valley</p>

<p>Sent a message up the hill,</p>

<p>Asking for the buried treasure,</p>

<p>Tons of gold for which they'd kill.</p>
</div>

<div class="lyrics">
<p>Came an answer from the kingdom,</p>
<p>&quot;With our brothers we will share</p>
<p>All the secrets of our mountain,</p>
<p>All the riches buried there.&quot;</p>
</div>


<p>Down by the water, a small boat gently knocks against a wooden dock. The water laps against stones on the edge of the mud below.</p>

<p>Later, as the sun begins to set, the blond haired boy sits thinking to himself, about the long summer, the girl and tiny band of pirates. A pair of crawdads scurries across the mud below.</p>
<p>&quot;No one really knows
  how long the shoreline is. Around all the rocks, stones and sand, it keeps wrapping around and round.&quot;</p>
<p>His mother soon arrives to pick him up. This is the last summer we'll see him, soon he'll be moving west. Across bigger fields and longer rivers.</p>
<p>-------</p>


<div class="lyrics">
<p>Go ahead and hate your neighbor,</p>
<p>Go ahead and cheat a friend.</p>
<p>Do it in the name of Heaven,</p>
<p>You can justify it in the end.</p>
<p>There won't be any trumpets blowing</p>
<p>Come the judgment day,</p>
<p><span class=GramE>On the bloody morning after....</span></p>
<p>One tin soldier rides away.</p>

<p>Now the valley cried with anger,</p>
<p>&quot;Mount your horses! Draw your sword!&quot;</p>
<p>And they killed the mountain-people,</p>
<p>So they won their just reward.</p>

<p>Now they stood beside the treasure,</p>
<p>On the mountain, dark and red.</p>
<p>Turned the stone and looked beneath it...</p>
<p>&quot;Peace on Earth&quot; was all it said.</p>

</div>

business consisting of at least nine large flatbed <span class=GramE>lorries</span>.
He is regarded in his village as a wealthy man."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span class=GramE>Jumping on the bed downstairs.</span> It’s in the living room. But the woman
  comes downstairs too soon. The smell of curry is always so strong in her
  upstairs apartment. One evening when I
  was sick, her husband came over with a spoonful of white powder.</p>



<p>10 years later:</p>



<p><span class=GramE>Coming out of the shower, fumbling on the
bedroom floor.</span> <span class=GramE>Wet
nirvana.</span> Step father arrives
home. <span class=GramE>Sneaking her
home.</span> <span class=GramE>The green
Toyota.</span> Bowie in Philadelphia on
the eight-track. <span class=GramE>Next
time, next life, white horses.</span> <span
class=GramE>Bliss, but always the concern about starting a family before we had
a chance to get a leg up.</span></p>



<p>2 years later:</p>



<p>In college book store on the West Coast, my friend Richard
said he’d never seen two people’s eye meet like that before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>What do you want to do? she 
says. I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right. Weeks later, ordering thai
food in tiny compartments on an earthen plate, each with a tiny lid.</p>



<p>I think back to who this brown haired girl is. She’d the girl behind the fence in the back
yard when I was 5 years old. Her father
would whistle for her with the loudest whistle I’ve ever heard, fingers in his
mouth. I’ve never been able to do that. I never really got to know her.</p>


<p>In the lines of unending fences that separate the Palestine
communities from Israel, a boy looks out at the young girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been a miner for a heart of gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keeps me searching for the heart of gold, and I’m getting
old.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve been in my <span class=GramE>mind,</span> it’s such a
fine line.&#8221;</p>



<p>4/6/2011</p>

<p>The man is coming home from work, and this time we see that the 
woman is turning toward him, arms outstretched. The girl behind the fence has
her arms outstretched toward the boy and she merges with the colorful fractal
patterns from the woman’s dress. They come
together, heart to heart.</p>

<p>I’ve moved to another level. The little girl behind the <span class=GramE>fence,</span> is the image
of all womanhood, arms out stretched to embrace. She becomes the cross, swirling with
fractals, the essence of all womanhood, open and inviting, and I am the same
cross - with my heart at the center, arms extended outward. The heart center is the open Mandelbrot, with
the opening extending into the cross shape like the opening of a flower, as
sexual as a Georgia O’Keefe painting. My entire body is an electrical
pattern. Last year it was just my
head. But this is a full body heart
chakra experience, the first I’ve ever had. <span class=GramE>The firing of memories throughout my body, rethinking
my perspective.</span> All the women
I’ve loved. And the cross is a level of
acceptance I’ve forbid myself since I was 5. When my mom left my dad, we became cast-outs in the eyes of the church
community. We found refuse in the folk
music sessions in the basement of another church –
an alternate service prior to the morning service.</p>


<p>In this cross I have acceptance. As I lie in bed, the energy coming back to
normal, my body is a constellation that is the backyard of my Illinois
home. My feet are north toward the girl
behind the fence. One leg is bent to the
neighbor girls – Kim my best friend and her younger sister Cara. <span class=GramE>Terri and Patti.</span> My head is our small house, where my mom is,
and my step mother will reside in this logic space someday on one side.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Our yard has an apple tree and sand box
which I imagine would be near my belly.</p>



<p>Refrain &#8220;Keeps me searching for a heart of gold.&#8221; I’ve found the heart of <span class=GramE>gold,</span>
it’s about loving all women-kind without guilt while respecting your mate and
best friend.</p>



<p>4/7/2011</p>



<p>We each had a hard cider last night at <span class=SpellE>Frontpage</span>
news. My <span class=SpellE>pidas</span>
gland wasn’t happy. It jerked me out of sleep – to rollover to my back. I tried crossing my lower legs as I’d seen
the sticks on the ground. Not sure which
leg to put of <span class=GramE>top.</span> <span class=GramE>Then I rollover to the right side.</span> First time this has happened. I see an image and then I say what it
is. About 5 or 6, as if I’m casually
thinking. I’m seeing the thought before
articulating it. The images are not
colorful. This is the black and white
space, mostly black with faint white form for edge. It’s not like they are coming to me
randomly. It’s as if I’m thinking the
thought, but seeing the thought a moment before I think it. This is truly a glimpse at my unconscious
thought. The shapes are the donut shaped
spiral, maybe the Mandelbrot, the face shape from the codex. I can’t remember them now. The alcohol slightly slowed down the response
time of my analytical self.</p>



<p><span class=GramE>I long to be able to visualize in color
and motion while retaining analytical thought.</span> The dreams we remember upon waking are
reflections experience only as memories. As I drift, I’m visualizing the heart chakra and how two hearts are
suddenly combined like magnets. <span
class=GramE>Arms outstretched and rotating together.</span> This is like the dance of the butterflies,
high in midair, spinning and held alight by the wind.</p>



<p>I’m also thinking about the moment of inception. That each life form starts as <span
class=GramE>a the</span> ripple of a Mandelbrot set. And each new idea is also a growing fractal
pattern.</p>



<p>How I want to see color. For an instance there is a green beyond the edge of the black. I can almost make out a green focal point in
the center.</p>





<p>Distraction is an inward swirl, the twirling of a piece of
hair around a girl’s finger. Focus is a
ripple, radiating outward. <span
class=GramE>The turning of a screwdriver.</span> In appreciating beauty, the ripple radiates
outward to a higher frequency – beauty is a duality (separating and
discriminating). To understand true
beauty, one most hold all things as beauty. This allows the swirl to be applied. <span class=GramE>To hold the inward and outward motion in balance, eventually
turning the sphere inside out.</span></p>



<p>Shit, that’s so profound. I’ve been to my <span class=GramE>mind,</span> it’s such a fine line.
Keeps me searching (turning) for a heart of gold. <span class=GramE>Time.</span></p>







<p>Subconscious </p>



<p>4/8/2011 – This morning I see a &#8220;Y&#8221; upside down. Almost burning, <span class=GramE>kind of</span> small. I’m thinking about what’s a good
position. Oh! My brain is telling me to
try allaying in that position. I roll on
my back. <span class=GramE>Where to put
my arms.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Put them on my
side. Now I’m <span class=GramE>seeing the</span> top half of a fork pointed downward. What’s that about? It lasts a little longer than. Oh! This is funny. With my arms at my
side I’m now the position of a fork. My subconscious took the time for me to
pick up on what it was conveying. I
shuffle around, but that’s the end of the images for the morning. Terri’s beside me so I don’t have room to
spread my legs like a full &#8220;Y&#8221;. I
suppose crossing my arms would allow me to avoid being an upside down fork.</p>


<p>If you're ever lost without a compass, use a cow or deer to
find true north. <a
