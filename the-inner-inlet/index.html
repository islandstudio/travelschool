<h1>The Inner Inlet</h1>

<p>Around the edge of the wide yard, we ran along the muddy banks of the creek that wove its way toward the inland marshes. 

The fields of waving cotton and tall corn rustled in a light breeze and a small boat rocked gently against a small wooden dock ahead.

The farm was several miles inland from the sheltering outer banks of the North Carolina coast, passed down through generations of the Millan family, dating back before the revolutionary war.</p>

<!-- in the summer of of 1975. This old coastal farm has been -->

<p>We swung out, long and wide, over the tidal water on a thick rope tied to a tall old willow tree whose branches dipped down into the slow current. Our heads passed inches from the surface of the water as we sailed out past the muddy bank. Crawfish moved through the shallow water, following the gliding shapes above with their inspecting eyes. A turtle made a resonating &#8220;plunk&#8221; as it slides off a log. Time is moving in slow motion on the hot North Carolina afternoon. An older man on the porch across the yard turns a book over in his hands and draws a sip from a tall glass of tea and listens to a scratchy song on the AM radio.</p>

<p>My name's Wilem. Wilem Wilkens. <!-- Son of Michael William Wilkens, Greggy, George and Jeff --> I've come here to this farm by the sea every summer since I can remember to hang out with the Millan boys.

Here on the north side of the inlet, protected by the Outer Banks, the winds are gentle, most days. An apple tree watches over the back yard and smaller fig trees form a row of silent sentinals along one side of the house. Across the green fields, an older, smaller white farm house stands by the end of a long line of magnolias.</p>


<p>We yell to each other as we run through the fields along the river, then plunge into the tidal stream before climbing the opposite bank and making our way out throught the tall corn, skin bristling against the stalks that shim and sway as we race towards the white house of the young girl who lives across the field.<br>
</p>

<p>Her father whistles loud, two fingers in his mouth.  The sound carries so far we swear he is standing in our own backyard.  Out across the fields it carries, and for a moment the cicada bugs are silent, listening to the long deep whistle sound curve and carry across the fields.  I've tried many times to whistle like that, it's a lost art.<br>

<br>
This is where we spent long summers, four boys filling lazy days with adventures. At seven, I was the youngest. 
Greggy was ten and George eleven.  Izzy, our fearless leader was twelve, almost thirteen. Their older brother Jeff was away at the academy.<br>
<br>

We peer into the corn fields, tall and bristly. It's running weather.  Hot turns to cold once we are in motion.  My legs aren't as long as theirs, but I keep up the best I can.
We cut into the fields and down the rows, corn towering over our heads.  We've stashed our shirts amid the weeds beneath the stalks.  The clods of dirt are uneven, and I trail behind, but I never lose sight of them.<br>
<br>
We come to the edge of the fields, peering through at the white house where the girl lives.  We never see her, only the linen drapes blowing in the window, catching the light of the late afternoon sun.</p>

<p>The heat of the hot southern day radiates off the roof of
her house. We wait, and listen.  Greg jokes and jabs his finger into Izzy's ribs to see if he can get him to make a peep, but we all remain silent, transfixed by the fabric blowing in the wind. All nine yards.</p>

<p>A dog barks in the distance. The moon is starting to rise and the sun has just barely set. It's almost dinner time, someone's stomach growls and our attention turns toward home.</p>

<p>On the big porch over the yard, the Millan boys' grandfather inspects an old metal coin. He runs his thumb along the edge. The muted metal was still partially encrusted with dirt, which contrasted with his starched white shirt. The thumb of his other hand was tucked under a black suspender as he rocked on the softly creaking porch, turing it between his index and middle finger.</p>

<p>"Hey mud rats, supper's almost ready. Throw your shoes in the yard, Mother just cleaned the floor and we've got company coming tomorrow." As they pulled up wooden chairs around the farmhouse table, their mother placed steaming plates of beans, corn and chitterlings around the table.</p>

<p>
After dinner their grandfather leaned back, a gleem in his eye. He began to tell a tale his own grandpa had told him many years ago.

<h2>Catch Sail</h2>

<p>
"300 years ago, not too far up the Carolina the coast from here," he began, looking around the table to draw us in, "18 young sailors set sail in the dark of night.  The Spanish fleet had bottomed out two days before, driving hard into the Florida shore during a hurricane. The North Carolina sailers were heading south after Spanish gold in a ship they had <i>stolen</i> - with permission of their own fathers. Their mothers were not in on their late night caper."</p>

<p> 
"Financed by wealthy land owners and politicians, the crew had high hopes of returning home wealthy men themselves, but other Spanish ships chased them away first."</b>

<p>"Rather than return home empty-handed, the young sailers headed north and began a series of misadventures whose stories grew over time to embody the renegade spirit of the southern coast. 
Their grandfather was especially fond of telling the the tales of their captain, Edward Teach, who would come to be known as Black Beard. Some of his crew were even rumored to have returned to prominent positions in this very county, near the original North Carolina capital of Bath."
</p>

<p>"Now I used to think these tales were just stories my own grand fater made up, until today. Until I found this on my way back from Bath at farmer Jan's field, along the Slyth Creek side." He pushed the gold coin to the center of the table.</p>

<p>The boys looked around at eachother and back to the coin. They knew exactly the area he was talking about. It's where they had been digging up old clay bricks the day before.</p>
